The front glass sunroof works like a sliding/tilting sunroof, the rear glass sunroof is a tilting glass sunroof. The Panorama glass sunroof is actuated in the usual way by its own control unit.<br><br>> - E53, E83 [system overview ...]<br>> - E61 [system overview ...] <br>> - E70 [system overview ...]<br>> - E91 [system overview ...] <br>The Panorama glass sunroof is available as special equipment (option 402).<br><b>Brief description of components</b><br>The following components supply the input signals for the Panorama glass sunroof:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Panorama glass sunroof switch</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The switch is located in the control unit in the roof console.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The switch can be moved in 3 directions (pushed forwards, pushed backwards, pushed upwards). <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Hall sensors in Panorama glass sunroof drive</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There are 2 Hall sensors integrated in each of the two electric motors for the Panorama glass sunroof. The Hall sensors detect the motor speed. The signals are forwarded to the SHD control unit (E70: FZD control unit). <br>These signals enable the control unit to recognize the position of the two glass sunroofs and of the 2-piece sliding visor. Moreover, the closing speed of each electric motor is used to calculate the closing force for the two glass sunroofs and for the sliding visor.<br>The control units involved in the functions of the Panorama glass sunroof are as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>SHD control unit (control unit for Panorama glass sunroof)</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The SHD control unit controls all the electrical functions of the Panorama glass sunroof. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E53, E61, E83, E91:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E70: <br>The SHD control unit is no longer fitted.

The Panorama glass sunroof is partially opened automatically. That means: Depending on the initial position of the Panorama glass sunroof, the sliding visor is first opened fully. Then, if the switch is again pressed beyond the pressure point, the glass sliding/tilting sunroof is opened. When it is opened, the sliding/tilting glass sunroof automatically moves to the comfort position (sliding/tilting glass sunroof approx. 3/4 open). The switch must be pushed again to completely open the glass sliding/tilting sunroof.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Automatic closing:<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The closing procedure is a reverse of the above.

The Panorama glass sunroof completely opens or closes automatically. When this happens, the sliding visor and the sliding/tilting glass sunroof open or close together. However, the sliding visor always moves out-of-line with the sliding/tilting glass sunroof. This ensures that the sliding visor is always slightly more open than the sliding/tilting glass sunroof as the sliding/tilting glass sunroof is opened or closed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tilt<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Push the switch for the Panorama glass sunroof upwards until it reaches its mechanical stop. The front glass sliding/tilting sunroof and the rear tilting glass sunroof are automatically lifted from every other position as long as the switch remains pushed.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Press the switch for the Panorama glass sunroof up twice within the space of 2 seconds. The Panorama glass sunroof moves to the "Vent" position, regardless of the starting position. <br>"Vent" position means: Both glass sunroofs are fully raised, the rear section of the 2-piece sliding visor is open about 3 cm (only E53, E61, E83) or the 2-piece sliding visor moves back about 5 cm (only E70, E91).<br><br><b>Note: Automatic closing is not possible if the anti-trap function fails.</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Automatic closing is not possible if anti-trap function fails (on account of defective Hall sensor, for example). Closing is then only possible with the mechanical emergency mode. <br>Any fault data is then stored in the SHD control unit (E70: FZD control unit).<br><br> <br><br><b>Convenience opening and closing</b><br>The controls that can be used for this purpose are as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Button on remote control (radio-control key)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the button on the remote control to "unlock" or "lock" and hold it in this position until the Panorama glass sunroof reaches the desired position.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Door lock on driver's door<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the mechanical key to turn the lock in the driver's door to the position for unlocking or locking, and hold it in this position until the Panorama glass sunroof reaches the desired position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Driver-side outside door handle and passenger-side outside door handle<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle is equipped with Comfort Access (CA), <b>convenience closing</b> can be started using the outside door handle electronics in the bow handle.<br>The convenience opening/convenience closing function is stopped if the command is cancelled.<br><br> <br><br><b>Emergency closing</b><br>Emergency closing is a function for deliberate closure of the Panorama glass sunroof without anti-trap function (closing-force limitation). Emergency closing may be necessary if someone attempts to reach into the interior of the car or if mechanical difficulty is experienced in closing the Panorama glass sunroof. <br>Emergency closing can be activated when the car is stopped or travelling at a speed up to 16 km/h.<br><br>To activate emergency closing:<br>Push the switch for the Panorama glass sunroof in the "close" direction until it reaches its mechanical stop and hold it there. The Panorama glass sunroof is closed with maximum force and maximum speed without anti-trap function. <br>If the Panorama glass sunroof is blocked, the electric motor continues to run until the overheating protection is activated.<br><br> <br><br><b>Anti-trap function (limitation of closing force)</b><br><br><b>Caution: Note initialization</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The Panorama glass sunroof has to be initialized in order for the anti-trap function to work correctly. The Panorama glass sunroof has to be initialized by service staff.<br><br> <br><br>Anti-trap function is active over the entire range of movement in the closing direction. <br>The anti-trap function works as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The sliding/tilting glass sunroof and/or the sliding visor is opened approx. 20 cm.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When closing from the "tilt" position, the sunroof will return to the "tilt" position.<br>Anti-trap function does not in principle prevent trapping; instead, it limits the maximum permissible force applied to the trapped object (by limiting the closing force).<br>To prevent impermissibly high closing forces, there are 2 Hall sensors integrated in each of the electric motors. The speed of closure can be measured on the basis of the signals from these two Hall sensors. The closing force is calculated from the speed of closure.<br>The mechanical forces involved change with ambient temperature and as a result of ageing processes. For this reason, the closing forces required are adapted during the closing process. <br>Automatic closing is not possible if anti-trap function fails (on account of defective Hall sensor, for example). Closing is then only possible with the mechanical emergency mode.<br><br> <br><br><b>Safety functions</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Maximum motor ON time</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If a motor runs in a single direction for longer than 15 seconds, the SHD control unit will deactivate the drive (E70: FZD control unit).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Overheating protection</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The heating of the electric motor is calculated in the SHD control unit (E70: FZD control unit). The outside temperature is available as a temperature signal (via the body bus or body CAN). Moreover, there is a temperature sensor on the board of the SHD control unit (E70: FZD control unit). After a certain temperature threshold is reached the overheating protection is activated. The drive is switched off.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Emergency operation</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In emergency mode, the Panorama glass sunroof can only be moved in small steps. <br>Emergency mode is possible in the following conditions:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Encoding in the SHD control unit (E70: FZD control unit) invalid.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Signal of a Hall sensor implausible<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Initialization incomplete<br><br><b>Note: Mechanical emergency operation<br>is possible</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>In case of an electrical defect, emergency mode of the Panorama glass sunroof is available. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>There is no emergency mode for the sliding visor.<br><br><b>Notes for service staff</b><br>Service staff should note the following points:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>General information: <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Diagnosis: ---<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Encoding/programming: <br><br>Subject to change.</div>
