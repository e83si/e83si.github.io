<h1>Operation</h1><br><br><br><b>Operation</b><br><br><b>Manual adjustment of drives</b><br>The adjustment switches in the switch block are used for adjusting the seat manually. The adjustment switch (with integrated control module) is located on the sides of the seats facing the door.<br><br>The following adjustments can be made with these switches:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Seat fore/aft adjustment<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Seat height adjustment<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Seat angle adjustment<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Seat angle adjustment<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Head restraint height adjustment (comfort seat E64)<br><br>An additional switch for the Easy Entry is fitted in the E64 in the seat, enabling rapid forward / back adjustment of the seat.<br><br><b>Programming a memory position</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>On the vehicle, the ignition lock must be in position 1 or 2.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Activate the memory button on the memory switch. Programming readiness is indicated by the memory button lighting up.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press one of the 3 position buttons to store the current seat position.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The indicator lamp goes out after pressing the position button.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Program readiness is canceled if no position button is pressed within <b>7 s</b>. The position button goes out.<br><br><b>Calling up a memory position</b><br>A differentiation is made between two operating modes when stored seat positions are retrieved:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Touch button operation:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In single-strike mode, it is enough to briefly press one of the 3 position buttons to start the positioning procedure. Positioning runs automatically until the target position is reached.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The touch button operation is effective if the driver's door is opened and the ignition-lock is in position 0 or 1.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With the driver's door closed, touch button operation is effective in ignition lock position 1.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Continuous button operation:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>To call up a seat position, the corresponding position button must be pressed continuously to maintain positioning. If the button is released before the target position is reached, the corresponding drive is switched off immediately. The positioning procedure is continued when the position button is pressed again. If another position button is pressed, the positioning procedure for the new position is started.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The continuous button operation is effective if the driver's door is opened and the ignition-lock is in position 2.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With the driver's door closed, continuous button operation is effective in ignition lock position 0 or 2.<br><br><b>Detection of end stops</b><br>In order to avoid unnecessary engine load and of the ripple count module, there is automatic detection of the adjustment range limits.<br><br>Should a block be detected several times in the same position, the detected position value is interpreted as the end stop. Any further adjustment is terminated before this limit is reached.<br><br>An incorrectly detected end stop (e.g. blocking of the seats caused by objects lying around) can be overridden after removal of the blocking, by activating the manual adjustment switch.<br></div>
