<h1>Current Measurement, Seat Heating</h1> <br><br><br><b>Current Measurement, Seat Heating</b><br><br>The current is measured in order to be able to provide a basic statement with regard to a defect in the seat heating system.<br><br><b>Measurement preparation</b><br>On vehicles equipped with a switching center in the center console, the current is measured directly at the switching center.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Switch off seat heating<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove center console switching center (A169)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Measurement is carried out with a <b>50 A</b> clip-on ammeter<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Unwind insulating tape from wiring harness under seat and attach clip-on ammeter to the wire to be measures.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Left seat heating: Measurement on HZFA wire (white/yellow, pin 1)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Right seat heating: Measurement on HZBF wire (white/green, pin 13)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start engine in order to ensure a system voltage of approx. <b>13.8 V</b><br><br><b>System voltage</b><br>If the system voltage drops below <b>11.4 V</b>, the LEDs remain lit but the seat heating is switched off. The seat heating is re-activated as soon as a voltage of at least <b>12.2 V</b> is permanently applied.<br><br><b>Measurement at DIS tester</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select "measurement system"<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Measurement function: Current <b>50 A</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Measurement connection: Clip-on ammeter<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Type of measurement: Direct current =<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Measuring range: +/- <b>50 A</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check system voltage with DIS tester<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Switch on seat heater on the side to be measured<br><br><b>Measurement evaluation</b><br>Generally applicable for all heating stages: Each heating stage has a certain setpoint temperature. The control unit attempts to reach this temperature as fast as possible. The temperature is the kept constant by means of clocking (= pulsating direct current).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Generally, the current is approx. <b>10 A</b> during the heating-up phase (at a system voltage of <b>13.8 V</b>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The heating output is reduced on approaching the setpoint temperature. The clocking function can now be distinctly recognized, i.e. the current pulsates between 0 and approx. <b>10 A</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>On finally reaching the setpoint temperature, the interval of the <b>0 A</b> range is extended even longer.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the current temperature is higher than the setpoint temperature, e.g. when, after a longer period of operation, the heating is switched back from stage 1 (3 LEDs) to stage 3 (1 LED), no current is applied until the temperature has again dropped to the corresponding setpoint temperature.<br><br><b>Heating-up seat</b><br>The duration of the heating-up phase is dependent on the temperature measured at the temperature sensor! The setpoint temperature is reached more quickly at high ambient temperatures (e.g. in summer) or if the seat is preheated. In this case, the clocking cuts in correspondingly earlier.<br><br><b>Measured power</b><br>The measured power depends on many different factors. Both the level of the system voltage as well as the type of seat installed and operation of other loads (seat heating on other side, steering wheel heating) play a significant role. The specified value of <b>10 A</b> is therefore only a reference value.<br><br><b>Setpoint temperatures</b><br>The following setpoint temperatures are reached in the three-stage seat heating system:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Stage 1 operation (3 LEDs lit):<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The seat is heated to a setpoint temperature of <b>35 degrees C</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Stage 2 operation (2 LEDs lit):<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The seat is heated to a setpoint temperature of <b>39 degrees C</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Stage 3 operation (1 LED lit):<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The seat is heated to a setpoint temperature of <b>44 degrees C</b><br><br><b>Measurement evaluation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A current of approx. <b>10 A</b> is applied:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The seat heating is OK<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A current of approx. <b>5 A</b> is applied:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Defect in heating mat of <a>seat cushion</a> or seat backrest<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No current is applied:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Defect in heating mat of <a>seat cushion</a> and seat backrest</div>
