The actual condition is compared with nominal values (values in stable driving conditions) that are calculated in the DSC control unit. If the actual condition differs from the nominal values, DSC is activated and initiates brake actions and/or engine control functions.<br><b>The advantages:</b><br>The intervention of DSC in the engine control and brakes provides outstanding driving stability and traction in all driving situations.<br>DSC combats negative, dynamic driving forces. This means DSC brings about maximum active safety within the physical limits. DSC thus enhances driving comfort by allowing more relaxed driving.<br><br><b>Brief description of components</b><br>The following components are described for the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC):<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>DSC unit</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The DSC unit consists of the components DSC control unit and hydraulic unit.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The DSC control unit regulates the pressure in the brake system via the hydraulic unit (comprises valve block and pump motor). <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Brake light switch</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The brake light switch tells the DSC when the brake pedal has been pressed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>4 wheel-speed sensors</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The active wheel-speed sensors register the speed of an individual wheel at their circumference.
