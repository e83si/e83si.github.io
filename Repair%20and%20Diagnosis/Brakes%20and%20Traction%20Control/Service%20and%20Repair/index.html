<h1>Brakes and Traction Control: Service and Repair</h1><br><br><br><b>34 00 ... - General Information</b><br><br>The brake system is one of the most important safety systems on any motor vehicle. It is therefore essential to act with utmost care when working on the brake system and to follow the instructions below.<br><br><b>General:</b><br>- Ensure cleanliness and only use rags which do not lose lint.<br>- Wash away or vacuum up brake dust, do not clear it away using compressed air. This dust is a health hazard.<br>- Do not under any circumstances allow any oil or grease to get into the brake system. This would result in a complete malfunction of the brake system.<br>- When cleaning brake components with brake cleaner (refer to BMW Parts Service), do not allow brake cleaner to get into in the brake system.<br>- Even the most minute traces of brake cleaner must be avoided.<br><br><b><a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Brake%2520Fluid/index.html">Brake fluid</a>:</b><br>- Replace brake fluid at least every two years.<br>- Never reuse drained <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Brake%2520Fluid/index.html">brake fluid</a>.<br>- Always use BMW-approved <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Brake%2520Fluid/index.html">brake fluid</a>, refer to BMW Service Operating Fluids.<br>- Dispose of <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Brake%2520Fluid/index.html">brake fluid</a> in approved appliances only, refer to BMW Service Workshop Equipment Planning documentation.<br>- Do not allow <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Brake%2520Fluid/index.html">brake fluid</a> to drain into drain pipes, into the outside environment or into unsuitable facilities. This would create the risk of groundwater contamination since brake fluid is classed as a fluid that is hazardous to water.<br>- Do not allow <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Brake%2520Fluid/index.html">brake fluid</a> to come into contact with paintwork as this will destroy the paint.<br>- <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Brake%2520Fluid/index.html">Brake fluid</a> must not be allowed to remain on bare skin too long in order to avoid skin problems. Wash skin coated with brake fluid with water and soap.<br>- If <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Brake%2520Fluid/index.html">brake fluid</a> makes contact with eyes, immediately flush with large quantity of clean water and visit eye doctor.<br><br><b>Wheel brakes:</b><br>- <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Brakes%20and%20Traction%20Control/Disc%20Brake%20System/Brake%20Pad/">Brake pads</a>:<br><a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Brakes%20and%20Traction%20Control/Disc%20Brake%20System/Brake%20Pad/">Brake pads</a> must be replaced when the warning threshold of the brake pad wear indicator is reached. <br><a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Brakes%20and%20Traction%20Control/Disc%20Brake%20System/Brake%20Pad/">Brake pads</a> must always be replaced on both sides of any axle.<br>The friction surfaces of the <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Brakes%20and%20Traction%20Control/Disc%20Brake%20System/Brake%20Pad/">brake pads</a> must not come into contact with oil or grease. The brake pads must be replaced if they are fouled by such substances.<br>In the case of rotation-dependent <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Brakes%20and%20Traction%20Control/Disc%20Brake%20System/Brake%20Pad/">brake pads</a>, make sure the arrow marking points in the direction of rotation of the brake disk for when the vehicle is moving forward. Brake pads with left/right markings must be fitted on the relevant side of the vehicle.<br>One-sided angled areas on the <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Brakes%20and%20Traction%20Control/Disc%20Brake%20System/Brake%20Pad/">brake pads</a> must be located on the disk contact side of the brake calliper for when the vehicle is moving forward.<br>- Brake discs:<br>Brake disks must not be scored or cracked. Furthermore, minimum brake disk thickness, disk runout, parallelism and surface roughness of the friction surfaces must not exceed or drop below the permitted values.<br>Always strip preservative off new parts before installation. With the rear brake discs, also strip preservative off brake drum on parking brake.<br>- Always strip preservative off new parts before installation.<br>- Brake callipers:<br>Only approved pastes on the basis of glycol must be used for repairs on brake callipers.<br>All moving parts on the brake calliper must move freely: note grease specifications.<br>Use only BMW-approved lubricants to grease calliper guides (refer to BMW Service Operating Fluids).<br><br><b>Brake lines, brake hoses:</b><br>- Brake lines and brake hoses must be correctly routed and must not abut with body or components in a way which would cause chafing.<br>- To prevent damage, release and tighten brake line couplings with a special brake line wrench only.<br>- The system must be bled each time any brake lines have been detached.<br>- All connection points must be checked for leaks.<br>- Only tighten down brake hoses on the front axle when wheels are in straight-ahead position.<br>- Close off open connections of brake lines and individual components to prevent dirt from getting into the brake system.<br>- When tightening down brake line couplings, observe tightening torque 34 32 1AZ <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Specifications/Mechanical%2520Specifications/Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/System%2520Specifications/34%252032%2520Brake%2520Lines/index.html">34 32 Brake Lines</a>.<br><br><b>Wheel-slip control system:</b><br>The wheel-slip control system is essentially maintenance-free; however the following must be observed:<br>- When carrying out welding work with electric welding equipment, be sure to disconnect the plug from the electronic control unit (ignition turned off).<br>- During painting work, the control unit may be subjected for brief periods to loads of max. 95 &deg;C and for long periods (approx. 2 hours) to loads of max. 85 &deg;C.<br>- Terminals must be completely tight on end poles of battery.<br>- Brake lines on hydraulic unit must not be swapped over: if applicable, mark them prior to disassembly.<br><br> <br><br>On completion of repair work, carry out swap-over test with the DIS diagnosis system.</div>
