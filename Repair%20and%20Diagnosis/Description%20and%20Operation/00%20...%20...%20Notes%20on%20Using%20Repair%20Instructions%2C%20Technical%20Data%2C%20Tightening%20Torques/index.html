<h1>00 ... ... Notes on Using Repair Instructions, Technical Data, Tightening Torques</h1><br><br><br><b>00 ... ... - Notes on Using Repair Instructions, Technical Data, Tightening Torques</b><br><br>These repair instructions are intended to help expertly carry out <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> and repair work.<br>They thus supplement the practical and theoretical training of master mechanics and fitters in BMW's Service Training Centers.<br>The Repair Instructions describes the removal, installation and replacement of subassemblies in the vehicle.<br>The Repair Instructions describe tasks which can be carried out on series-production BMW Group vehicles and vehicles which have not been subsequently converted.<br>Cross-references to "Technical Data" and "Tightening Torques" must be complied with.<br>If there are no cross-references to tightening torques in the repair instructions, the excerpts from the company standard BMW N 600 02.0 must be observed.<br>Cross-references to other flat rate units are intended as an aid and can refer to a complete work operation or merely to individual work steps contained therein.<br>Cross-references to other flat rate units must not be considered as an extension of the labor performance standard.<br>The structure of the Repair Instructions corresponds to the numbering system of the flat rate manuals (flat rate units).<br>Note: With the exception of inspection operations, no flat rates are published for the E52 (Z8) model series. However, the numbering system (flat rate units) is retained.<br>Furthermore, the corresponding microfiches of the repair instructions are valid for the E12, E21, E24, E28, E30, E31 and E34 model series.<br>The microfiche is also valid for the E32 model series with the following exception: For the 750i, 750Li models and the job description 31 31 000 Replacing front left or right spring strut, the TIS CD must be used!<br>In general, the individual work steps of the Repair Instructions describe only the removal of subassemblies. All removed subassemblies are reinstalled in reverse sequence. If particular features need to be observed during installation, they are identified as notes on installation. In contrast, complicated removal and installation procedures are described separately.<br>Further information on repair operations can be found on the "Commercial Service Data CD (KSD CD)". For the E39, E46 and E53 model series and the following model series, it is possible after selecting the FRU items to activate the corresponding information via the Text and Inclusive Items buttons.<br>Improvements and modifications are published regularly in service information bulletins.</div>
