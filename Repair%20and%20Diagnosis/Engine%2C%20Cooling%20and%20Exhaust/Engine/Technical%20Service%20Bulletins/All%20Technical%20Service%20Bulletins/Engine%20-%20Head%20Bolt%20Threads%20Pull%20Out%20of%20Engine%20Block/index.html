<h1>Engine - Head Bolt Threads Pull Out of Engine Block</h1>SI B11 06 06 <br>Engine<br><br>May 2012 <br>Technical Service<br><br>This Service Information bulletin supersedes SI B11 06 06 dated June 2006.<br><br><b>[NEW]</b> designates changes to this revision <br><br>SUBJECT <br>Head Bolt Threads Stripping Out of Block During Engine Reassembly <br><br>MODEL <br><b>[NEW]</b> All with aluminum engine block <br><br><b>[NEW]</b> SITUATION <br>While performing the torque procedure on the cylinder head during engine reassembly, the head bolt threads strip out of the block. Typically this occurs during the repair of an engine that has been overheated.<br><br>CAUSE <br>Overheat condition has weakened the structure of the aluminum block assembly in the area of the bolt threads. <br><br><b>[NEW]</b> PROCEDURE <br>In cases where an engine needs to be disassembled due to an overheating event, the following steps should be taken: <br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Before removing the cylinder head, loosen and retorque each head bolt to ensure thread strength and integrity. <br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the engine block threads strip (pull out of the engine block) during the retorque, replace the engine block with <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Engine%252C%2520Cooling%2520and%2520Exhaust/Engine/Cylinder%2520Block%2520Assembly/Piston/index.html">piston</a> or complete "short" engine assembly as determined and supported by the repair/replacement cost analysis. <br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If all head bolts achieve correct torque, proceed with cylinder head removal. Once removed, use a straight edge on the block surface, as well as the cylinder head, to determine if any deviation caused by the overheat is present. If applicable, be aware of any protrusion of the cylinder liners above the surface of the engine block. <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Note:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Some engines and engine blocks require TeileClearing approval before replacement. <br><br><b>[NEW]</b> WARRANTY INFORMATION <br>For covered repairs where the approved BMW repair instructions allow for the repair or replacement of a part, component, or assembly, a repair must be performed as long as the cost of repair does not exceed 75 percent of the cost of replacement of the part, component or assembly. <br><br>Please see "Repair or Replacement of Parts, Components or Assemblies" in the BMW Warranty Policy and Procedures Manual: Section 5 - Supplemental Information. </div>
