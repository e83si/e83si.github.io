<h1>Body/Frame - Structural Repair Requirements</h1>SI B 41 01 04 	<br>Body<br><br>October 2007 <br>Technical Service<br><br>This Service Information bulletin supersedes S.I. B41 01 04 dated April 2005.<br><br>SUBJECT<br>Structural Repair Requirements<br><br>MODEL<br>All except E52-Z8<br><br>SITUATION<br>All BMW models use advanced materials and fastening technologies. Materials such as High Strength Steels and Weld Bonding attachment methods require the use of unique repair procedures, processes and tools.<br><br>PROCEDURE<br>BMW models have specific repair procedures and fixed tolerances. BMW requires the use of an approved repair bench and measuring system when replacing any structural components of a BMW vehicle.<br><br>BMW defines the structure of a vehicle as the components that comprise the body shell that are weld-bonded, rivet bonded or welded on. Currently the only approved bench repair systems are:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Car Bench - Manta, Piranha, Murena, or Octopus repair benches in conjunction with dedicated fixtures, mini jigs or universal fixtures. The Contact electronic measuring system is also approved.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Celette - dedicated bench system with fixtures, or the NAJA electronic measuring system with positioning tool NA. 1000<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Car-O-Liner bench system and electronic measuring system used in conjunction with:<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Car-O-Flex or EVO 3 Universal fixture system<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>B66, or B76-B77 side support, or EVO 1 and 2 support system - any one (1) of these three (3) is required<br><br>Car Bench, Celette, and Car-O-Liner work closely with BMW in designing and building fixtures within BMW specifications, which not only provides accurate component location, but also provides safe and proper anchoring of the vehicle.<br><br>BMW also separates the different repair bench setups into two categories:<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Diagnostic setup - A fixture setup used for diagnosing damage. This setup is not designed to anchor the vehicle in any way, but only supports the weight of undamaged areas in order to maintain a proper datum line. This setup may require removal of exhaust systems, suspension components, splash shields, etc. The benefit is accurate dimensioning and diagnosis with minimal removal of components. This set up is typically used during the blueprinting stage of the repair to develop an accurate repair plan.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Anchoring setup - A fixture setup used for anchoring a vehicle while making corrective pulls. This setup uses a minimum of six (6) anchoring points including four (4) rocker clamps and two (2) additional fixtures in the damaged area. This set up is common with universal type repair benches because of the limited holding capacity of a universal system. Depending on the damage the vehicle may require more anchoring points which is determined by a trained BMW Body Repair Technician, but six (6) is the minimum for any vehicle requiring corrective pulls. With a dedicated repair bench more holding points are necessary in the area requiring corrective pulls.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Combination Setup - Utilization of both diagnostic and anchoring setup for repair (i.e. Diagnostic setup in rear for the undamaged area of vehicle and anchoring setup in front for the damaged area of the vehicle). The advantages are labor time savings and less removal and installation of components. This setup may only be used in conjunction with rocker / jack clamps. To determine if this setup can be utilized a trained BMW Body Repair Technician must create a repair plan to ensure proper anchoring can be accomplished.<br><br>This equipment can be purchased through the BMW Equipment Program, which offers special pricing and payment/financing options.
