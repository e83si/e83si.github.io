When performing such a repair to any of these sets, the TIS/ISTA Repair Instructions (REP) should always be consulted. <br><br>Due to the complex nature of these repairs, a set of complementary instructions with additional detail, explanation, and photos has been developed. The attached Repair Instructions should always be used in conjunction with the TIS/ISTA REP.<br><br>Refer to the following repair attachments: <br><br>Front Glass Mechanism repair E53, E61, E70, E83, E91.pdf <br><br>Rear Glass Mechanism repair E53, E61, E70, E83, E91.pdf <br><br>Wind Deflector Mechanism repair E53, E61, E70, E83, E91.pdf <br><br>Sunshade Mechanism repair E53, E61, E83.pdf <br><br><b>[NEW]</b> Sunshade Mechanism repair E70, E91.pdf <br><br>All panoramic roofs for the above-listed models are conceptually similar and utilize similar repairs. <br><br><b>NOTE:</b><br>An E83 (X3) sunroof cassette is used for demonstration of the repairs.
