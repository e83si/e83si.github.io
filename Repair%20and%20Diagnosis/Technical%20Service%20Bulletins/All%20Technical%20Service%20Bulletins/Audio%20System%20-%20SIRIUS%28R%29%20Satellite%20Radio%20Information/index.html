<h1>Audio System - SIRIUS(R) Satellite Radio Information</h1>SI B65 02 05<br>Audio, Navigation, Monitors, Alarms, SRS<br><br>February 2012<br>Technical Service<br><br>This Service Information bulletin supersedes SI 65 02 05 dated April 2006.<br><br><b>[NEW]</b> designates changes to this revision<br><br>SUBJECT<br>SiriusXM Satellite Radio: How It Works<br><br>MODEL<br><b>[NEW]</b> All<br><br><b>[NEW]</b> Vehicles equipped with option 655 (Satellite Radio)<br><br>INFORMATION <br>What is satellite radio in general?<br><br>It is a subscriber-based radio service that is broadcast directly from satellites. Subscribers will be able to receive up to 100 radio channels featuring compact disc digital quality music, news, weather, sports, talk radio and other entertainment channels.<br><br>Basically, it is an additional radio band. Unlike AM and FM, which are transmitted from earth-bound transmitters, satellite radio comes primarily from a signal sent via satellites orbiting the earth.<br><br>Satellite radio signals are digital and the satellites cover the entire continental US.<br><br>This means channels have no geographic boundaries, and when driving across the country, satellite radio should not encounter static or fade.<br><br>However, brief reception loss or distortion may occur when the satellite receiver in the vehicle loses sight of the satellite: for example, in dense urban areas surrounded by high-rise buildings; under trees; in tunnels; or in some mountain valleys.<br><br>When such reception losses occur, "Acquiring" is shown on the radio display. This is normal operation and requires no further diagnosis.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b><br>SiriusXM has already installed land-based repeaters to minimize these occurrences. <br><br>How does SiriusXM satellite radio work?<br><br><b>[NEW]</b> Sirius satellite radio is a Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS) service operating in North America, owned by SiriusXM Radio.<br><br>Programming originates and is managed in the broadcast studio of SiriusXM, and transmitted to multiple high-powered satellites positioned in orbits above the U.S.<br><br>The signal will then be broadcast from the satellites directly to satellite radio-capable receivers across the United States.<br><br><b>[NEW]</b> For more detailed information, please log on to the SiriusXM website:<br><br>Satellite radio will not disrupt any existing radio signal. It is still possible to listen to local AM and FM stations.<br><br><b>[NEW]</b> What is necessary for a SiriusXM satellite radio to operate in BMW vehicles?<br><br>To receive SiriusXM satellite radio in a BMW, three main components are needed:<br><br>1. SiriusXM-compatible audio system<br><br>2. Satellite antenna<br><br>3. Activated SiriusXM satellite radio receiver<br><br>The SiriusXM Satellite Receiver is a module that either is already part of the head unit (CIC, RAD2+ radio, etc.) or it mounts as a separate control module in the rear of the vehicle.<br><br>The receiver is unique to BMW and specifically designed to work with SiriusXM satellite radio technology, integrating seamlessly into the BMW bus network system.<br><br>The receiver module deciphers the satellite signal and converts it into an audio signal that is then sent to the vehicle's audio system.<br><br>The receiver will have a test channel (CH 184) to make sure the receiver is functioning.<br><br>The receiver must be activated to receive complete SiriusXM programming.<br><br>The BMW center activates the receiver via BMW CenterNet or a SiriusXM call center.<br><br>The Satellite Antenna is mounted on the roof on most models, and on the trunk of others.<br><br>Due to the technology of satellite radio transmissions, the antenna must be on the metal surface of a predefined area.<br><br>SiriusXM satellite radio is available for the following BMW vehicles:<br><br>Factory Installation<br><br>Refer to the availability chart on the SiriusXM website: www.siriusxm.com/vehicleavailability/b<br><br>Retrofit<br><br>Only vehicles with option 693 (Satellite Tuner Preparation)<br><br>Refer to the compatibility chart (Sirius Application and Parts Information) for retrofit kits in the Electronic Accessory Information Portal on BMW CenterNet.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b><br>SiriusXM satellite radio is not available for the Z3 Roadster/Coupe, Z8 and E38 models.<br><br><b>IMPORTANT:</b><br>For newer BMW models, it is necessary to activate the satellite radio receiver through an enabling code.<br><br>For additional information on enabling codes (ordering, downloading, installation), refer to Service Information B09 04 09 and B09 05 09..<br><br></div>
