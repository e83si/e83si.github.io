<h1>Light Bulb - Replacement Guidelines</h1>SI B 63 02 01<br>Lights<br><br>August 2010 <br>Technical Service<br><br>This Service Information bulletin supersedes SI B63 02 01 dated March 2001. <br><br>[NEW] designates changes to this revision<br><br>SUBJECT<br>Light Bulb Replacement - Incandescent and Halogen Light Bulbs<br><br>MODEL<br>ALL excluding Xenon light bulbs and light-emitting diodes (LEDs)<br><br>[NEW] SITUATION<br><br>Functional testing of incandescent and halogen light bulbs replaced under warranty and returned to the Warranty Parts Return Center (WPRC) along with the analysis of light bulb claim data shows that some of these light bulbs are:<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Being replaced unnecessarily;<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Incorrectly handled during a previous repair or replacement; or<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Not replaced, as a set, when they should have been<br><br>This can result with unnecessary additional warranty costs, service visits and reduced customer satisfaction.<br><br><b>Note:</b><br>The situation above does not apply to Xenon bulbs that may only be replaced as instructed after running the corresponding ISTA test plan.<br><br>[NEW] PROCEDURE<br><br>When replacing incandescent and halogen light bulbs, always follow the guidelines listed below:<br><br>1. Before replacing these light bulbs, confirm that they are defective (most times a broken filament can be seen visually). If there is no visual confirmation, test the bulb using a multimeter or 12-volt power supply with a suitable bulb holder to confirm that the bulb is defective.<br><br>2. A failed light bulb with distinctly "blackened" glass indicates a failure. In situations where the failed vehicle bulb as a "twin" with the same function (for example, left and right parking lights), replace the other bulb as well if it also found to be "blackened" in the same way.<br><br>3. Only replace light bulbs when the lighting system is switched off or when the vehicle is powered down.<br><br>4. Do not touch any bulb glass directly with your fingers - this will cause local overheating spots and premature bulb failure. The best practice is to hold the bulb using a clean cloth or while wearing clean gloves. Clean off any dirty bulbs as necessary.<br><br>5. Before installing the replacement light bulb, check the bulb holder contacts for traces of oxidation and clean if necessary. Check for adequate contact force.<br><br>6. In cases where a vehicle has had repeated light bulb failures, check the wiring system supply voltage using ISTA diagnosis.<br><br>7. Use only genuine BMW replacement light bulbs sourced through the BMW NA Parts department to help avoid bulb compatibility issues.<br><br>[NEW] WARRANTY INFORMATION <br><br>For information only<br><br>The bulb replacement reason including the applicable guidelines listed above must be stated on the repair order and in the corresponding claim comment section.<br><br>Please follow the standard warranty parts documentation and retention procedures for all bulb replacement repairs.<br></div>
