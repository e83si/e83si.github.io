This status is retained (also after disconnecting/reconnecting the battery) until the button is pressed once again or if a crash is detected.<br><br><b>Switch-on conditions</b><br>The general module switches on the interior lighting under following conditions:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Interior light switch is pressed<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle door is opened (detection via door contact)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Crash is detected (recognition via "crash detection" input)<br><br>The following further switch-on conditions are dependent on the coding data and can be encoded differently depending on the country-specific version and car/memory:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle is unlocked via door lock or remote control<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Terminal R switched off when headlights were switched on for at least <b>2 minutes</b> beforehand.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remote control (search function) - press arm button with vehicle locked/armed (wait <b>10 seconds</b> after arming)<br><br><b>Switch-off conditions</b><br>The interior lighting is switched off:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Immediately after switching on terminal R when all doors are closed<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Immediately after locking/arming vehicle when all doors are closed<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>20 seconds</b> after closing all doors<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>20 seconds</b> after unlocking vehicle when no door has been opened<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>8 seconds</b> after activation via remote control (search function)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After <b>16 minutes</b> with door open and ignition lock in position 0 (terminal R off)<br><br><b>Interior lights dimmed</b><br>The setting as to whether the interior lighting is switched on and off dimmed (soft on) or not dimmed (soft off or hard) is defined in the coding data of the general module.<br><br><b>Load deactivation</b><br>Consumer units such as reading lights, lighting for the glove and luggage compartments can also be switched on when the vehicle is parked. However, these loads are switched off <b>16 minutes</b> after switching off terminal R in order to conserve the battery.<br><br>Control of the consumer shutdown takes place via general module 5. The lamps stated are connected via the cable VA (consumer shutdown) at the general module. The general module switches B+ to the loads.<br><br>After the consumer units have been switched off, they are switched on again when terminal R is switched on or when a signal change occurs at an input of the general module, e.g. opening a door, opening the engine hood, unlocking a door.</div>
