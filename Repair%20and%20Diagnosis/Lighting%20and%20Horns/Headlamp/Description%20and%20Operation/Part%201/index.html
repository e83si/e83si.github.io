This improves illumination of the curve of the road. <br>Visibility is therefore improved. <br>When cornering, the driver is not looking into a "black hole" - instead, the adaptive headlights allow the driver to see the curve of the road. <br><br>> - E46/2, E46/C, E53 and <br>E83 until 09/06 <br>[system overview ...] <br>> - E83 from 09/06 <br>[system overview]<br><br><b>Note: AHL control unit discontinued from 09/06.</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>On the E83 from 09/06, the software for the AHL control unit is integrated into the light module (LM). The AHL control unit is no longer fitted.<br><br> <br><br>The turning lights function is new on the E83 from 09/06. <br>The turning lights give the area next to the carriageway additional illumination when you are turning or cornering (driving in tight bends). The function is also active when you are parking.<br>The turning lights are realized using the front foglights. The front foglights have a specially shaped reflector to illuminate the areas to the sides better.<br><br><b>Note: Turning lights only in conjunction with option 524.</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Turning lights are a subfunction of option 524 "Adaptive headlights".<br><br><b>Brief description of components</b><br>The following components and control units provide input signals for the adaptive headlights system:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Light switch </b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The rotary switch for the side lights and dipped headlights differs depending on the vehicle equipment level (adaptive headlights, automatic driving lights control, automatic or manual headlight-range adjustment). For the adaptive headlights function to operate, the light switch must be set to position "A" ("A" = "automatic driving lights control" or "adaptive headlights"). <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Turn-signal/main-beam switch</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The main-beam headlights are switched on and off with the direction indicator / main-beam switch (by pressing or pulling the switch). The adaptive headlights function operates with both dipped and main-beam headlights.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Ride-height sensors</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the special equipment "Adaptive headlights" is fitted, the adaptive headlights control unit evaluates the signals from the ride-height sensors. <br>This is because: the adaptive headlights control unit also controls the automatic headlight-range adjustment. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The automatic headlight-range adjustment feature adjusts the vertical aim of the headlights to compensate for variations in the vehicle tilt angle (e.g. when the vehicle is laden, and under braking and acceleration in dynamic driving situations). <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Brake%2520Light%2520Switch/index.html">Brake light switch</a></b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle is equipped with the "adaptive headlights" option, the signals from the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Brake%2520Light%2520Switch/index.html">brake light switch</a> are read by the control unit for the adaptive headlights. <br>The signal sent by the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Brake%2520Light%2520Switch/index.html">brake light switch</a> is an input signal for the automatic headlight-range adjustment; see above: Ride-height sensors.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Zero-position sensor</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E46/2, E46/C<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E83<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The zero-position sensor in the AHL headlight sends a signal for calculating the zero position of the AHL headlight.

The headlights are tilted up and down as required, but they are not swivelled towards the bend in the road.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>In darkness, the rain-light sensor sends the message "Darkness". The adaptive headlights are then activated when the vehicle is cornering. The headlights are moved to the left or the right:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Steering-angle sensor and DSC sensor</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The steering angle sensor and DSC sensor (DSC = Dynamic Stability Control) supply signals for the adaptive headlights to the adaptive headlights control unit. These signals are evaluated as follows, depending on the vehicle's speed:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Vehicle speeds up to <b>30 km/h</b>:<br>The adaptive headlights function is controlled using the information from the <b>steering angle sensor</b> (in the steering column switch cluster).<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Vehicle speeds between <b>30 km/h and 50 km/h</b>: <br>In the 30 to 50 km/h speed range, there is a <b>continuous transition</b> in signal evaluation: from the evaluation of signals sent by the steering angle sensor to evaluation of the signals sent by the yaw-rate sensor (in the DSC sensor). <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>In extreme dynamic driving situations</b>, e.g. if the vehicle starts to skid or fishtail, even at speeds less than <b>50 km/h</b>, the signals from the yaw-rate-sensor are considered. <br>If the vehicle starts to skid or fishtail, the headlights will move to the straight-ahead position. The headlights are not moved until the vehicle has stabilized. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Vehicle speeds over <b>50 km/h</b>: <br>At speeds upwards of 50 km/h, the signals from the <b>yaw-rate sensor</b> (in the DSC sensor) form the primary basis for control of the adaptive headlights function. <br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Reason: For a constant cornering radius, the steering angle required increases disproportionately with speed. In addition, the steering angle required also depends on the coefficient of friction of the road surface. <br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The yaw rate is directly proportional to speed. For this reason, the yaw rate is always the most suitable measure for controlling the adaptive headlights at high speeds. <br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Even at high speeds, however, the steering angle sensor signal is used to detect (predict) the driver's commands <b>in advance</b>. This prediction is important: The yaw rate signal is not supplied until the vehicle has <b>responded</b> to the steering wheel movement.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The steering-angle sensor signal is disabled so that rapid, momentary steering adjustments do not affect the adaptive headlights function.<br>A number of control units are involved in the adaptive headlights system (see above: GM, EGS, KOMBI). <br>Depending on the series and model concerned, the adaptive headlights are actuated by the following control units:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>AHL control unit</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E46/2, E46/C, E53 and E83 until 09/06<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The AHL control unit controls the adaptive headlights. <br>For safety reasons, the AHL control unit is also responsible for the automatic headlight-range adjustment. This is because: Oncoming traffic must not be dazzled by the adaptive headlights. If a headlight sticks in an unfavorable position, the AHL control unit will attempt to move this headlight down (using the stepper motors in the automatic headlight-range adjustment). <br>The AHL control unit is connected to the K-bus and the PT-CAN. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>LM: Light module</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E83 from 09/06<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The AHL control unit is integrated in the light module. <br>The light module controls and monitors all vehicle lights.
