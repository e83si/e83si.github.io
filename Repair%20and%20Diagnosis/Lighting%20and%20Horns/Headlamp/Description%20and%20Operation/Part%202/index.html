<h1>Part 2</h1><br><br><br><b>63 03 03 (047)<br>Adaptive headlights<br>E46/2, E46/C, E53, E83</b><br><br><br><b>System activation and automatic calibration</b><br>When terminal 15 is switched ON, the headlights always perform a calibration sequence, even if the dipped headlights are not switched on. The control unit for adaptive headlights (AHL control unit or light module) sends the "perform calibration sequence" prompt to the stepper motor controllers (SMCs, control unit for the headlight stepper motors). The stepper motor controllers actuate the stepper motors in the headlights. The calibration sequence is performed. <br><br>In the calibration sequence, the headlights move as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The headlights move to the right and the left (= calibration sequence for adaptive headlights).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The headlights move up and down (= calibration sequence for automatic headlight-range adjustment). <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>At the end of the calibration sequence, the headlights are in the straight-ahead position.<br>Following the calibration sequence, the system is ready for operation. <br>When reverse gear is engaged, the headlights are moved to the straight-ahead position.<br><br><b>Note: The calibration sequence is performed only after terminal 15 has been switched OFF for at least 15 seconds.</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If terminal 15 is repeatedly switched on and off (e.g.for demonstration purposes), the calibration sequence will not be executed every time terminal 15 is switched on. Terminal 15 must have been switched off for at least 15 seconds before it is switched on again. Only then is a calibration sequence performed when terminal 15 is switched on.<br><br> <br><br><b>Activation of stepper motor controllers </b><br>The control unit�for�adaptive�headlights (AHL control unit or light module) sends the stepper motor controllers (SMC) the nominal values for the positioner modules (position of positioner modules and speed of movement). <br>The control unit for adaptive headlights calculates the nominal values using the following signals:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle road speed<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Steering angle (at speeds up to 50 km/h, dependent on encoding)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Yaw rate (50 km/h upwards, see "Steering-angle sensor and DSC sensor" above)<br><br> <br><br><b>Speed-dependent analysis of signals</b><br>The adaptive headlights are controlled by the following signals depending on the road speed: signals from the steering angle sensor or signals from yaw-rate sensor (in the DSC sensor). The encoding (at the end of the production line) determines the priority assigned to sensor signals above which speed threshold (see above).<br><br> <br><br><b>Adjustment of headlight horizontal aim</b><br>The stepper motor controllers move the headlights to the right or left when the vehicle corners.<br>Horizontal range of movement of headlights:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inwards, i.e. towards center of vehicle: up to max. 8&deg;<br>> E46/2, E46/C, E83: 7&deg;<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E53: 8&deg;<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Outwards: up to max. 15&deg;<br>Example: Right-hand bend: <br>The right-hand headlight turns by up to 15&deg; (the right-hand headlight is the "inside" headlight on a right-hand bend). <br>It therefore swivels outwards away from the vehicle center. <br>The left-hand headlight swivels through a maximum of 8&deg; (the left-hand headlight swivels towards the vehicle center, i.e. inwards). <br>The headlight on the outside of the bend reaches its end position at the same time as the headlight on the inside of the bend, ensuring that the road is evenly illuminated. <br>On a right-hand bend, the left-hand headlight is on the outside of the bend. The right-hand headlight is on the inside of the bend.<br><br> <br><br><b>Deactivation of adaptive headlights function under extreme handling conditions </b><br>If the vehicle drifts, skids and loses sideways grip, the adaptive headlights function is deactivated as follows: <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The headlights are returned to the straight-ahead position. The headlights are no longer turned.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The dipped headlights remain on.<br><br> <br><br><b>Deactivation of adaptive headlights function in response to system faults </b><br>In the event of a system error, the indicator light on the light switch will flash. <br>Dazzling of oncoming traffic must be prevented in the event of a system fault. <br>For this reason, the adaptive headlights function is deactivated as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the stepper motors are still functional, the headlights are returned to the straight-ahead position. The headlights are no longer moved towards bends in the road.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If it is no longer possible for a headlight to be moved back to the straight-ahead position, the headlight is tilted downwards (by the stepped motors for automatic headlight-range adjustment). This prevents dazzling of oncoming traffic.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the headlight cannot be tilted downwards, the bi-xenon bulb in this headlight is disabled as follows: <br>When the vehicle is parked up, the control unit registers sleep mode for the adaptive headlights, as follows: Standstill and terminal R OFF for several minutes. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The next time the vehicle is restarted, the bi-xenon light of the defective headlight is not switched on. <br>The front foglights are switched on in order to ensure a minimum level of illumination. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The dipped headlight is <b>not</b> switched off while the vehicle is in motion.<br><br> <br><br><b>Setting headlights to parked position</b><br>When terminal R is switched off, the headlights move to the parked position. The parked position is important for the headlights' next calibration sequence. From the parked position, the headlights are run through a calibration sequence in the pre-drive-check. During the calibration sequence, the control unit for adaptive headlights relearns the straight-ahead position for the headlights.<br>When the headlights have reached the parked position, the stepper motor controllers SMCs inform the control unit for adaptive headlights ("verification"). <br>The control unit for adaptive headlights deactivates the stepper motor controllers. The run-down period lasts approx. 10 seconds.<br><br> <br><br><b>Automatic headlight-range adjustment </b><br>If the special equipment "Adaptive headlights" is fitted, the control unit for adaptive headlights also controls the automatic headlight-range adjustment. <br>The automatic headlight-range adjustment adapts the headlight range for different operating conditions. <br>Variations in the vehicle tilt angle are produced by vehicle loads and braking or acceleration in extreme driving situations. The automatic headlight-range adjustment moves the headlights up and down as required. <br><br>The control unit for adaptive headlights also controls the automatic headlight-range adjustment as follows.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ride-height sensors and the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Brake%2520Light%2520Switch/index.html">brake light switch</a> supply the signals for the automatic headlight-range adjustment. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The control unit for adaptive headlights computes the vehicle inclination (longitudinally to the roadway) from the signals.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The stepper motors for the automatic headlight-range adjustment automatically and dynamically control the headlight range.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The headlight range is adjusted so that the actual headlight range conforms to the legally required headlight range as follows:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If vehicle rear is lower than front: <br>The actual headlight range will be longer than the legally stipulated range. The headlight beam height is lowered to reduce the headlight range to match the legal requirement.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle is horizontal: <br>The actual headlight range will be the same as the legally stipulated range.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If vehicle front is lower than rear: <br>The actual headlight range will be shorter than the legally stipulated range. The headlight beam height is raised to increase the headlight range to match the legal requirement.<br><br> <br><br><b>Adaptive headlights for automatic driving lights control</b><br>The automatic driving lights control feature (option in conjunction with the rain-light sensor) switches the side lights and dipped headlights on and off automatically.<br>Switch-on conditions:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The automatic driving lights control must be encoded in the light switch cluster or light module. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The light switch must be in position A" ("A" stands for automatic driving lights control and for adaptive headlights).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The rain-light sensor must be installed and operational.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The rain-light sensor detects the brightness of the ambient light. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The rain-light sensor sends the following prompts to the light switch cluster or the light module: <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Ambient brightness low: In twilight, darkness, in an underground garage or tunnel. <br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>"Switch on dipped headlights" request<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Ambient brightness sufficient.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>"Switch off dipped headlights" request<br>If only the side lights are to be switched on, the light switch must be set to side lights (switch position 1).<br>When the light switch is set to position "A", the control unit for adaptive headlights is also activated:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the automatic driving lights control function switches on the dipped headlights (e.g. at twilight), the adaptive headlights function is notified at the same time. <br>The control unit for adaptive headlights then assumes control of the automatic headlight-range adjustment. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In addition, the signals from the rain-light sensor are also evaluated. The headlights are not turned when the vehicle is cornering until total darkness sets in.<br><br>The message "dipped headlights on" is given individually for each headlight.<br>If a headlight fails, the adaptive headlights are switched off. <br>The front foglights are switched on in order to ensure a minimum level of illumination.<br><br> <br><br><b>Turning lights</b><br>> E83 from 09/06<br>The turning lights are coupled to the adaptive headlights (option 524). <br>Depending on actuation, the right-hand and/or left-hand front foglight is switched on. The turning lights are actuated by the light module (LM). The turning light are not switched on suddenly but rather faded according to special time parameters.<br>Depending on the country concerned, the turning lights are switched on when cornering.<br><br>The following conditions must be satisfied for the turning lights to be <b>switched on</b>:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Terminal 15 ON<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Light switch in position "A" ("A" stands for automatic driving lights control)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Rain-light sensor detects twilight or darkness (threshold exceeded)<br><b>and</b> <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a>Turn signal indicator</a> ON (not one-touch turn signal)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Speed range (forwards): <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Europe and Japan version from 0 km/h to 35 km/h <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>US version from 0 km/h to 65 km/h <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Swivel angle (theoretical): <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>when stationary &ge; 77&deg;<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>when driving &ge; 10&deg; <br><b>Alternatively</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Speed range (reverse): <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>0 km/h to 35 km/h <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Swivel angle (theoretical): <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>when stationary or driving &ge; 70&deg;<br>If the vehicle is stationary, the turning lights will automatically be deactivated after a certain time, e.g. when waiting at traffic lights.
