<h1>Electrical - Updated Battery Registration Procedure</h1>SI B61 15 12 <br>General Electrical Systems<br><br>April 2012 <br>Technical Service<br><br>SUBJECT <br>Updated Battery Registration Procedure<br><br>MODEL <br>All <br><br>SITUATION <br>With the release of ISTA (Integrated Service Technical Application) D2.30.6 or later, an updated battery registration test plan has been introduced. The test plan allows the technician to enter a 12-digit "Data Code Matrix" or 6-digit "Supplier Number" that is easily read off the new battery. This will allow for tracking of the new battery in the vehicle, which will improve quality control of replacement batteries. <br><br>PROCEDURE <br>In order to obtain the proper numbers required by the test plan, before installing the replacement battery, note the 12-digit "Data Code Matrix" or 6-digit "Supplier Number" from the new battery. These numbers can be found on top of the battery. The next 2 steps will provide examples of the numbers. <br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/681512387.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The 12-digit "Data Code Matrix" shown in this example is "11B336BE2015" and is a combination of numbers and letters. <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Note:</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Not all replacement batteries have this code. If this is the case, use the 6-digit code identified in step 2. <br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/681593162.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The 6-digit "Supplier Number" shown in this example is "165902". If this number is entered in the test plan, you also need the numbers stamped on top of the negative post of the battery, for example, "46 11." <br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the numbers have been obtained and the battery is installed in the vehicle, start diagnosis using ISTA D2.30.6 or later. <br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select "Identification / Vehicle selection / Read out vehicle data / Start identification." A vehicle test is not necessary in order to perform battery registration. <br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select "Activities / Service function / 03 Body / Power supply / Register battery change / Start search." <br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select the test plan "AS6120_WECHSEL - Register battery replacement." <br><br>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Once the test plan starts, select "Register battery replacement."<br><br>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The test plan reads out the current battery that is registered in the vehicle. Select the appropriate entry that applies to the replacement battery:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>"Enter battery replacement: same capacity" <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>"Enter battery replacement: higher/lower capacity" <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>"Enter battery replacement: Change from normal lead-acid battery to AGM battery" <br><br>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The test plan then asks the question, "Is there a data matrix code on the label of the newly installed battery?" <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select "Yes" if the 12-digit code displayed in step 1 is present. After yes is selected. proceed to step 10. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select "No" if the 6-digit code displayed in step 2 is present. After no is selected, proceed to step 11. <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Note:</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Most replacement batteries only have the 6-digit code on the new battery.<br><br>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The test plan prompts to "Enter second line of data matrix code as described (<b>Note!</b> Upper and lower case sensitive)." Enter the 12-digit code recorded from the new battery in step 1 with no spaces, for example, "11B336BE2015." Select "Next" when finished.
