A supplementary control unit monitors both battery circuits. Depending on the situation, the battery circuits are connected to or isolated from the supplementary control unit via an isolating relay.<br>Two AGM batteries, whose design and properties are described in AGM batteries <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Starting%2520and%2520Charging/Battery/Description%2520and%2520Operation/AGM%2520Battery/index.html">AGM Battery</a>, are used as a storage battery.<br><br><b>Important!</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>These batteries must not under any circumstances be charged with a voltage in excess of 14.8 V. Rapid programs must not be used either.<br><br><b>Receiving/giving starting assistance via jump start terminal</b><br><br>The engine can be jump-started with an external voltage supply via the jump start terminal on the right side of the engine compartment.<br><br><b>Note:</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The starter battery is isolated from the alternators when the engine hood/bonnet is open.<br><br>Giving starting assistance via the jump start terminal is thus limited by the capacity of the starter battery when the engine hood/bonnet is open.<br><br><b>Charging starter and equipment batteries via jump start terminal</b><br>The starter battery is charged as a matter of priority with a charger connected to the jump start terminal. The voltage at the starter battery is the decisive factor in determining whether the equipment battery is also included in the charging operation. The supplementary control unit automatically detects a charging operation at a charging voltage at the starter battery of &ge; 13.5 V. The isolating relay is closed and thus the equipment battery is connected in parallel. Both batteries are now charged. <br>Prerequisite:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Terminal 61 inactive<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Terminal 15 inactive<br>If terminal 15 becomes "active" during the charging operation, the isolating relay is opened immediately and again only the starter battery is charged.<br><br><b>Note:</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the engine hood is open, the isolating relay is also opened in normal operation when the engine is running.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A special mode can be set by means of diagnosis for workshop/garage operation. The isolating relay is closed from terminal R in this operating mode. This mode is automatically reset once a distance of 5 km has been driven.<br><br><b>Trickle charging</b><br><br>The increased closed-circuit current consumption can be compensated for via the jump-start connection point with the aid of the "Acctiva easy" battery trickle charger (Service Information 2 03 05 205).<br><br><b>Important!</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The cigarette lighter is isolated from the electrical system after terminal R "OFF" on a timed basis (60 mins.), thereby interrupting charging of the equipment battery via the cigarette lighter. This is prevented if the battery master switch (on the right side of the luggage compartment behind the panel) is turned on and off again twice within 2 seconds.
