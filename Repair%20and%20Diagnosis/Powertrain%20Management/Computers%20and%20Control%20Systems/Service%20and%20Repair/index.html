Consequently, before disconnecting the car's battery, always interrogate the fault memories. Investigate stored faults and, once any faults have been remedied, cancel the fault memory.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a>Control unit</a> plugs should only ever be connected and disconnected while the ignition is turned off.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The removal and installation of components, relays, fuses etc. can cause faults to be stored in fault memories capable of self diagnosis.

The control unit receives different input values, depending on engine condition, which are compared with the stored values. The adaptive system compares the input values with the stored <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Manifold%2520Pressure%252FVacuum%2520Sensor/index.html">map</a> values.
