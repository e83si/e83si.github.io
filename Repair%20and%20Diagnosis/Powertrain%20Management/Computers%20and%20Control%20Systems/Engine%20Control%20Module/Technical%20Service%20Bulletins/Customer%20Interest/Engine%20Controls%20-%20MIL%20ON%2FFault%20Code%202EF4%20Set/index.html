<h1>Engine Controls - MIL ON/Fault Code 2EF4 Set</h1>SI B12 07 06<br>Engine Electrical Systems<br><br>October 2009<br>Technical Service<br><br>This Service Information bulletin supersedes SI B12 07 06 dated June 2009.<br><br>[NEW] designates changes to this revision<br><br>SUBJECT<br>"Service Engine Soon" Lamp Illuminated: FC 2EF4 Map Thermostat<br><br>MODEL<br>E90, E91 (3 Series) all models equipped with N52 engine<br><br>E60, E61 (5 Series) all models equipped with N52 engine<br><br>Vehicles produced up to March 2006<br><br>E83 equipped with N52K produced up to September 2008<br><br>SITUATION<br>The customer complains that the "Service Engine Soon" lamp is illuminated while driving. DME fault code 2EF4 Thermostat Map Cooling is stored. In some instances, the customer also complains about insufficient vehicle heating.<br><br>CAUSE<br>E83 Vehicles<br><br>DME software calibration error<br><br>E60 Vehicles<br><br>1.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>DME software error<br><br>2.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Internal leakage in the radiator causing an insufficient heating effect<br><br>E90 Vehicles<br><br>1.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>An unsatisfactory weld causes interference between the thermostat and the plastic housing. This condition applies only to BEHR Map Thermostats (black plastic housing). Thermostats manufactured by WAHLER (silver aluminum housing) are not affected.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Internal leakage in the radiator causing an insufficient heating effect<br><br>PROCEDURE<br><br>E83 Vehicles<br><br>1.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Reprogram the DME with ISTA/P 2.31.1 or higher.<br><br>E60 Vehicles<br><br>1.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Run the vehicle to operating temperature; a short ten-minute drive may be needed.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Connect the vehicle to DIS Plus or GT1 to monitor the Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor and Radiator Output Temperature Sensor.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Allow the vehicle to idle for approximately 5 minutes in the workshop; record the values of the two temperature sensors.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>A difference of 20&deg; Celsius should exist between the two temperatures. If the temperature difference is less than 20&deg; Celsius, replace the radiator and reprogram the vehicle with Progman 23.0 or higher. If the temperature difference is greater than 20&deg; Celsius, only reprogram the vehicle with Progman V23.0 or higher.<br><br>Example: The engine temperature = 95&deg; Celsius and the radiator outlet temperature = 67&deg; Celsius.<br><br>E90 Vehicles<br><br>1.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Run the vehicle to operating temperature; a short ten-minute drive may be needed.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Connect the vehicle to DIS Plus or GT1 to monitor the Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor and Radiator Output Temperature Sensor.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Allow the vehicle to idle for approximately 5 minutes in the workshop; record the values of the two temperature sensors.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>A difference of 20� Celsius should exist between the two temperatures. If the temperature difference is less than 20&deg; Celsius, replace the radiator. If the temperature difference is greater than 20&deg; Celsius, proceed to step 5.<br><br>Example: The engine temperature = 95&deg; Celsius and the radiator outlet temperature = 67&deg; Celsius.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Verify the production date of the thermostat. Thermostats produced prior to November 25th, 2005, are affected. The production date of the part can be found above the BMW Roundel on the plastic housing.<br><br>Example: 25-11-2005 = 25th day of November 2005<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Removing the thermostat from the vehicle is not necessary to view the production date. The production date can be seen from the top of the engine bay, looking downward, using a droplight or flashlight.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If affected, replace the thermostat in accordance with Repair Instruction RA 11 53 000, Removing and installing/replacing coolant thermostat (N52).<br><br><b>Note</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>BMW recommends filling the cooling system for protection against freezing down to -4&deg;F (- 37&deg;C). This means an antifreeze ratio of 50% antifreeze and 50% water. In severely cold areas, the antifreeze can be increased to 60%, which provides freezing protection down to -62&deg;F <br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>(-52&deg;C). Do not exceed a 60% ratio of antifreeze.<br><br>The specified antifreeze ratio is important, since an insufficient amount would impair antifreezing and corrosion-inhibiting protection. An excessive amount would not improve freezing protection, but would instead reduce freezing protection. At all times, the antifreeze and water should be premixed before pouring into the engine. If premixing is not performed, damage will occur to the water pump assembly.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/129865237.png"></div><br><br><br><br>PARTS INFORMATION<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/129869439.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/130065104.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>WARRANTY INFORMATION<br>Covered under the terms of the BMW New Vehicle Limited Warranty, or the Certified Pre-Owned program.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/12806369.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
