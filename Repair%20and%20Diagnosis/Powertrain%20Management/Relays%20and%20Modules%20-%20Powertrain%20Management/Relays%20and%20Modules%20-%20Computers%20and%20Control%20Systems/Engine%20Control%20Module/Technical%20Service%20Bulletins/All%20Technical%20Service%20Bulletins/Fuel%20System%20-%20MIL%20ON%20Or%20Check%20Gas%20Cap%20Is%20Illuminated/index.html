<h1>Fuel System - MIL ON Or Check Gas Cap Is Illuminated</h1>SI B12 20 10<br>Engine Electrical Systems<br><br>January 2012<br>Technical Service<br><br>This Service Information bulletin supersedes SI B12 20 10 dated September 2011. <br><br><b>[NEW]</b> designates changes to this revision<br><br>SUBJECT<br>Service Engine Soon Lamp or Check Gas Cap Is Illuminated<br><br>MODEL<br>E82 and E88 (1 Series) N51, N52K, N54, N54T and N55 engines up to 5/2011 production<br><br>E90, E91, E92 and E93 (3 Series) with N51, N52, N52K, N54, N54T and N55 engines production up to 5/2011 production<br><br>E60 and E61 (5 Series) with N52, N52K and N54 engines all production<br><br>E70 and E72 (X5 and X5 M) with N52K, N55, N63 and S63 engines up to 5/2011 production<br><br>E71 (X6) with N54, N55, N63 and S63 engines up to 5/2011 production<br><br>E83 (X3) with N52K engine up to 5/2011 production<br><br>E85 and E86 (Z4) with N52K engine up to 5/2011 production<br><br>E89 (Z4) with N52K, N54 and N54T engines up to 5/2011 production<br><br>F01, F02 and F04 (7 Series) with N54 and N63 engines up to 5/2011 production<br><br>F07 (5 Series Gran Turismo) with N55 and N63 engines up to 5/2011 production<br><br>F10 (5 Series) with N52T, N55 and N63 engines up to 5/2011 production<br><br>F12 and F13 (6 Series) with N63 engine up to 5/2011 production<br><br>F25 (X3) with N52T and N55 engines up to 5/2011 production<br><br>SITUATION <br>The customer states that the Service Engine Soon lamp is illuminated. When diagnosed, one of the following faults is stored in the DME fault memory:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DMTL Tank Leakage: Fine leak fault codes 3140, 321C, 2A15, 2B25, 190200, 190201<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DMTL Tank Leakage: Super fine leak fault codes 3141, 321D, 2A16, 2A14, 2B28, 190300, 190302<br><br>CAUSE<br>Incorrectly installed fuel cap, evaporative system leakage or tank ventilation valve (TEV) that has been jammed open.<br><br>PROCEDURE<br><br>1. For all vehicles outlined above, perform the applicable test plan diagnosis module for the tank leak DMTL, and follow the attached diagnostic fault tree for the fault(s) stored.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If a leakage is found, continue following the test plan to find the resolution. Refer to SI B16 01 07 for troubleshooting procedures, using the VACUTEC(R) Smoke Machine 625-522B-BMW.<br><br>2. If no tank leakage is found using the applicable test plan and the attached diagnostic fault tree, then review the vehicle history. If this is the first time for this complaint and the vehicle history does not indicate a single instance of the Service Engine Soon (SES) lamp illumination in the past for any complaint, then:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Do not replace any parts and do not initiate a smoke test of the evaporative system.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Confirm the operation of the fuel cap and advise the customer of the importance of installing the fuel cap properly to avoid tank leakage faults (see attached diagnostic fault tree for additional customer information).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle has had the Service Engine Soon lamp illuminated in the past and no tank leakage is currently present using the applicable test plan, proceed to step 3.<br><br>3. Replace the tank ventilation valve only if the vehicle was produced prior to 5/2011 and the tank ventilation valve has not already been replaced since 5/2011. Refer to REP 13 90 500 for replacement procedures.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>[NEW] Note:</b><br>TeileClearing authorization is no longer required for the tank ventilation valve replacement procedure described in this bulletin.<br><br>PARTS INFORMATION FOR REPEAT VISIT ONLY<br>Refer to the current version of EPC for the latest available replacement tank ventilation valve part number.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/128922146.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/128932162.png"></div><br><br><br><br>WARRANTY INFORMATION <br><br>ATTACHMENTS<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/128942160.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Diagnostic Fault Tree - Tank Ventilation Valve (Purge Valve)<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/129255222.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Diagnostic Fault Tree: EVAP System Overview<br><br><br><br><br></div>
