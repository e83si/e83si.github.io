There is thus no need for a <a>fuel return line</a>.<br>The fuel passes through the pressure regulator into the left side of the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> and thereby drives a suction jet pump. This pump repumps the fuel from the left side of the tank to the right side.<br>The <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Fuel%2520Rail/index.html">fuel rail</a> is return-free.<br><b>Tank venting system (US version):</b><br>The <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> is vented during refuelling via the refuelling vent line.<br>Because of its large cross-section, the refuelling vent line directs the displaced volume (fuel vapors) at high speed through the expansion volume to the carbon canister.<br>The activated carbon retains the fuel contained in the fuel vapors. The cleaned air is discharged to atmosphere via the evaporation line, the tank leak diagnosis module and the dust filter.<br>During driving, the system tank is vented in the same way via the vent line.<br>The condensed constituents of the fuel vapors remain in the tank because the tank has an integrated compensating volume.<br>The refuelling shutoff valve in the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> is closed by the rising fuel if the fuel tank is overfilled. The ventilation function is maintained by a second float valve. <br>Al three valves are designed as rollover valves. This prevents fuel from escaping from the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> in extreme vehicle positions (overturning, inclined position).<br>The carbon canister is regenerated by purging with fresh air.<br>The DME control unit opens the tank vent valve. Thus the vacuum pressure of the engine intake manifold is applied at the purge air line. The carbon canister is purged in this way. The fresh air needed for this purpose is supplied via the tank leak diagnosis module and the dust filter. The fuel constituents bound by the activated carbon are flushed out by the supplied air and directed via the purge line to the engine for combustion.<br>This operation is only possible while the engine is running.<br><b>Tank venting system (worldwide):</b><br>Refer to Tank venting system (US version) with following differences:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Carbon canister has a smaller capacity.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No tank leak diagnosis module or dust filter.<br><b>Leak diagnosis for tank venting system (US version):</b><br>The tank leak diagnosis module (see drawing 5.2) serves to diagnose leakages for the tank venting system within the on-board diagnosis laid down by legislation.<br>The tank venting system is pressurized and the pressure loss is detected in the event of a leak.<br>The tank leak diagnosis module is activated by the DME control unit and detects the pressure loss by way of the power consumption of the integrated pump. The air required for this purpose is supplied via the dust filter.<br>The pressure test line establishes the connection between <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> and fuel filler neck.
