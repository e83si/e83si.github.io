The carbon is incorporated in the carbon canister as granulate. The large surface of the carbon stores the fuel vapors which occur in the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a>. The carbon canister must be regenerated on a regular basis so as to be able to continue storing fuel vapors. Regeneration is performed by way of purging with fresh air via the intake manifold. This process is controlled by the engine control unit.<br><br><b>Fuel supply systems, diesel engines</b><br><br> <br><br>Fuel system<br><br>The electric fuel pump in the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> supplies the engine with fuel.
