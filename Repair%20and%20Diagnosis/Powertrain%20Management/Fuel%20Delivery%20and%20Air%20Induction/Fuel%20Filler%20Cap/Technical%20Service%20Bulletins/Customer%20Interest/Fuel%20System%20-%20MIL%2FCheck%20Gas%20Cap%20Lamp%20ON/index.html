When diagnosed, the DME has stored faults for a small leak, micro leak, super fine leak, or large leak in relation to the tank ventilation or evaporative system.<br><br>CAUSE<br>Leakage is detected in the tank ventilation or evaporative system.<br><br>PROCEDURE<br><br>1.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Run the Tank Leakage (DMTL) test plan, using the current diagnostic device loaded with the latest software. If a leak has been detected, remove the fuel cap and inspect for damage, i.e., the seal is torn; the seal is worn; or the seal is curling. If any damage is detected, replace the fuel cap and run the Tank Leakage (DMTL) test plan again, to check repair effectiveness.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If no damage has been detected, reinstall the cap and run the DMTL test plan again.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If the system is now leak-proof, the customer may have incorrectly installed the fuel cap. No further action is necessary. Advise the customer that after refueling, the cap must be fitted tightly until a click is heard.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If the system continues to leak, refer to SI B16 01 07 for detailed leak diagnosis procedures; replace any parts that were identified as leaking.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/463349270.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/463359606.png"></div><br><br><br><br>WARRANTY INFORMATION<br>Covered under the terms of the BMW New Vehicle Limited Warranty or the Certified Pre-Owned program for procedures 1, 2 and 4 only.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/12806369.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer</div>
