In combustion, ethanol provides less energy than gasoline, resulting in reduced fuel economy. When ethanol burns inside the engine, it tends to form a weaker mixture that may cause misfire, rough idle and cold start issues in your vehicle. In addition, engine components may deteriorate overtime when in contact with ethanol.<br><br>Consequently, commercial gasoline is limited to a maximum of10% ethanol. As stated in your BMW Owner's Manual, fuels containing 10% or less ethanol will NOT void the applicable warranties covering defects in materials or workmanship.<br><br><b>Detergent additives and how they affect fuel quality.</b><br>Detergent additives have been required by the EPA in gasoline since 1995 to control the formation of engine and fuel system deposits. Lower quality gasoline is formulated with less effective and less expensive detergent additives. Over time, even occasional use of this gasoline robs your engine of its power, performance and fuel efficiency.<br><br><b>What gasoline does BMW recommend?</b><br>BMW recommends using TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline with a minimum octane rating of AKI 91. This gasoline also complies with the 10% orless ethanol requirement. It's a higher standard with enhanced fuel detergency that helps to avoid driveability problems.<br><br><b>Get better performance from a cleaner engine with BMW Group Fuel System Cleaner Plus.</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/496569095.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>If TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline is unavailable in your area, how can you make sure your BMW gets the full amount of detergent it needs to burn cleanly and run smoothly?
