<h1>Fuel System -  Injection/Induction System Cleaning: Overview</h1>SI B 13 01 07<br>Fuel Systems<br><br>August 2010 <br>Technical Service<br><br>This Service Information bulletin supersedes SI B13 01 07 dated August 2010. <br><br>[NEW] designates changes to this revision<br><br>SUBJECT<br>Fuel Injection and Induction System Cleaning<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/515356350.png"></div><br><br><br><br>MODEL<br><br>SITUATION<br><br>Deposits found in the injection and induction system may cause the vehicle to experience a variety of drivability complaints, eventually leading to the Service Engine Soon lamp to be illuminated. Some of the possibilities are listed below.<br><br><b>Fuel Injectors</b><br><br>Deposits at the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Fuel%2520Injector/index.html">fuel injector</a>'s tip can impact fuel flow, disturbing the air/fuel mixture ratio.<br><br>Symptoms are the following: Hesitation or stumble during acceleration, or even loss of power; poor fuel efficiency; increased emissions of HC and CO; and "Service Engine Soon" lamp illumination due to misfire faults, or lean mixture adaptations.<br><br><b>Intake Valves</b><br><br>Deposits at the valves and on the intake manifold ports can absorb fuel during the warm-up phase, leaning out the air/fuel mixture ratio. Carbon buildup may disturb the mixture flow at low throttle conditions and/or <a>idle speeds</a>.<br><br><b>Symptoms are the following:</b> Poor drivability; loss of power; unstable and/or rough idle; increased emissions of HC, CO and NOx; and "Service Engine Soon" lamp illumination due to intermittent misfire faults.<br><br><b>Combustion Chamber</b><br><br>Combustion Chamber Deposit Interference (CCDI) occurs when there is contact between carbon deposits on the piston crown and the cylinder head. The noise can be confused or misdiagnosed as a ping, knock, or other noises that could indicate a mechanical failure. CCDI occurs first as a cold start noise that can fade as the engine warms to operating temperature. The noise will reoccur at the next cold start. As deposits build, there is an increase in compression temperature that may cause pre-ignition detonations.<br><br><b>Symptoms are the following:</b> Knocking; pinging; run-on; poor acceleration; octane requirement increase; increased emissions of NOx; and engine <a>idle speed</a> surges.<br><br>Depending on the manufacturer, fuels may contain various additives such as: oxidation and corrosion inhibitors; metal deactivators; emulsifiers; and anti-icing agents and dyes. In addition, they are required to include some form of an intake system deposit control package. Unfortunately, not all fuels are created equal, and some additive packages are not effective enough to maintain the integrity of the intake systems in high performance engines, or engines operating under severe environmental conditions. Even worse, the intake system deposit control additives in some fuels may actually contribute to the combustion chamber deposits accumulation, and to the problems associated with those deposits, i.e., knock, run-on and increased emissions of oxides of nitrogen.<br><br>To remedy these complaints, the BMW Group has developed a new special tool and cleaner concentrate to clean the fuel injectors, induction system and combustion chamber of harmful deposits.<br><br><b>Note:</b><br>The fluids and tools described in this Service Information bulletin are the only BMW approved items that can used to clean the fuel injection system, induction system and combustion chamber. Using non-approved fluids or tools can lead to premature component failure and will not be covered under Warranty.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/515369482.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Fuel%2520Injector/index.html">Fuel Injector</a> and Induction System Cleaner Concentrate<br>P/N 82 14 0 428 376<br>1 bottle, 16 fl. oz.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/515403927.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Fuel%2520Injector/index.html">Fuel Injector</a> and Induction System Cleaner Applicator<br>Kit P/N 82 14 0 429 692<br>This item will be shipped via the automatic Tool Shipment Program.
