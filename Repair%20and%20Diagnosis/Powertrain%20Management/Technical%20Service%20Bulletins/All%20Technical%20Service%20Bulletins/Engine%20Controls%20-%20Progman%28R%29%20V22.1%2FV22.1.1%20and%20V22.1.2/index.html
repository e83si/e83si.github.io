<h1>Engine Controls - Progman(R) V22.1/V22.1.1 and V22.1.2</h1>August 2006<br>Technical Service<br><br>SI B 09 16 06<br>Programming/Coding Explanation<br><br>SUBJECT<br>Release Notes Progman V22.1 and V22.1.1 and V22.1.2<br><br>MODEL<br>All<br><br>SITUATION<br>Progman V22.1 and V22.1.1 and V22.1.2 have been released. Certain errors may occur during installation or usage.<br><br>CAUSE<br>Software error<br><br>COMPLAINT<br>The following issues are currently known:<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>"Back" button is missing after the "Change" button in the menu bar has been selected.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An incorrect CIP version may be displayed on the "Online update" screen after a JETStream update.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>It may no longer be possible to use the GT1 after selecting "Update software".<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In some cases, no status display (white screen) appears for a few minutes if a measures plan is cancelled.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No FASTA data has been transferred for a long period of time.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>SSS enters service mode during the day, and it is no longer possible to start a session.<br><br>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The user interface may show "# 4" following a full installation using Progman V22.0 <br><br>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The following error message may be displayed when an SSS is selected with GT1 or DISplus: "The document contained no data. Please try again later or contact the server administrator."<br><br>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If a vehicle order is imported from a diskette that cannot be read "diskette not inserted, vehicle order not valid, etc." error message is displayed. The next screen does not appear for a few minutes after a button is pressed.<br><br>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If SSS name is changed it causes the SSS to reboot. After rebooting the new SSS name is then displayed on the "SSS overview" screen but not transferred to the JETstream server. The workshop personnel are NOT restricted in their work, but they do see an incorrect SSS name on the JETstream management console.<br><br>11.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E36: Coding of the ASC <a>control unit</a> following an ECU replacement may abort with error 1080 (CoApi) - incorrect coding key.<br><br>12.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E36: The last digit is not displayed when codes are entered using the virtual keyboard.<br><br>13.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E36: It is not possible to update the programming of the EPROM (DME MDS41.0 EPROM).<br><br>14.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E36 / E38 / E39 / E46 / E52 / E53: Retrofits and conversions may or may not be offered on vehicles with ZCS, even if they are not valid for the vehicle concerned.<br><br>15.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><=E53: Vehicle information may be exchanged between two sessions running simultaneously for vehicle series with ZCS code. In addition various errors may occur in the handling of older series with Progman (especially during replacement of <a>control units</a>).<br><br>16.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E60/E90: On CCC vehicles, there is a possibility that the MOST ECUs can only be flash programmed using DIAGBUS.<br><br>17.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E60/E65/E90: The FDM (Flexible Diagnostics Module) retrofit cannot be carried out successfully because the FDM <a>control unit</a> does not respond correctly.<br><br>18.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E9x/E6x/E65: At present, the TEL repair (NAD) can only be carried out using the SSS. Operation using GT1 or DISplus is not possible.<br><br>19.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E65/E60/E61/E63/E64: The measures plan states that enabling codes must be imported even though neither the NVE <a>control unit</a> nor the night vision camera need to be re-enabled<br><br>20.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E85: EPS encoding may not work after programming.<br><br>21.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E90: service function for "LWS" may not work.<br><br>PROCEDURE<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Button is hidden behind the "Minimize" button, no workaround.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignore the incorrect CIP version displayed.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Proceed as follows: 1. Disconnect the GT1 cable and wait until an error message notifies you of the loss of connection. 2. Reconnect the cable. 3. Update the SSS list. 4. Select the SSS again and end the session in the usual way.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wait until the next screen appears. This may take a few minutes.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check all FASTA and online service settings. If everything is correct, reinstall Progman. However, the existing FASTA data will be lost.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Go to "Operating State" on the SSS, press "Cancel" and wait about 1-2 minutes.<br><br>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Restart the system manually.<br><br>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not touch the button repeatedly as the link with the SSS is being established. A successful transfer is indicated by a light gray bar in the top right corner.<br><br>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wait for the next screen.<br><br>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After a change in the SSS name, call up the "Dealership data" screen. Carry out a manual transfer of the dealership data and reboot SSS.<br><br>11.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No workaround currently available.<br><br>12.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignore the display. Code is still accepted even though it is not shown.<br><br>13.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No workaround possible.<br><br>14.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignore the retrofit and conversions offered in error.<br><br>15.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Only one vehicle of these older series per SSS may be connected and handled. Especially if a <a>control unit</a> is being replaced.<br><br>16.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Workaround possible by means of data modification. Consequently, the MOST ECU on CCC vehicles can only be programmed via the MOST.<br><br>17.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The FDM retrofit is not currently available for customer vehicles.<br><br>18.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Only the SSS may be used for the TEL repair process.<br><br>19.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If night vision camera functions correctly, it is not necessary to import a new enabling code.<br><br>20.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Reprogramming module.<br><br>21.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Repeat service function for "LWS"<br><br><b>Additional notes</b>:<br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>All: A MOST connection must be established between the OP(P)S and the vehicle when programming vehicles with a MOST bus.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>E65: A battery reset must be carried out after programming a vehicle produced 03/05 or later if CD (Control Display) was part of the measures plan. However, oil level information will then be lost => Solution: run the engine at idling speed for 20 minutes.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>E65: In isolated cases, the DME control unit for 12-cylinder engines aborts programming with error code "2082  Error clearing flash". This concerns <a>control units</a> with HW* number 7537117 (integration level E065-03-12-500 to E065-05-03-810) and earlier. The control unit then no longer responds. Workaround: power reset.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/12806369.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br><br><br><br><br></div>
