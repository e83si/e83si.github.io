Afterwards, the customer tries to hang up the call via the MFL or i-Drive/C1D.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>The handset battery becomes exhausted during a phone call.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>The handset drops a call because of poor cellular reception.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>The customer is on an active call and receives a "Call Waiting" call.<br><br>The call has been terminated on the Motorola handset. However, the handset does not send a confirmation message to the vehicle that the call was successfully terminated. Therefore, the call is still shown as active in the vehicle (ghost call).<br><br>CORRECTION<br>Do not replace any parts! This problem is caused by a handset software error. Please create a PuMA case (Info only) documenting the customer's concern. The PuMA case should include the handset model number and the software version installed in the handset.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Customer work around procedure: The customer should switch off, and then switch back on, their handset or switch off and back on the Bluetooth function in the vehicle.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>BMW's solution: BMW will introduce a fix to allow the TCU to terminate the call if the MFL button is pressed a second time. On E65, E66 vehicles, the End Call button on the phone board must be pressed, not the MFL button.<br><br>Because the handset did not send the Terminate Call command to the vehicle the TCU will continue to show the call as active in the vehicle (ghost call). Unfortunately, because of Bluetooth� technology limitations, BMW's long term software fix will have an issue. If the customer makes a second call without the Bluetooth� bond being terminated, the new call will be disconnected. This is because the TCU and the handset are in two different modes. If the customer then presses the phone button on the MFL a second time, the handset will connect the call.<br><br>For E60, E61, E63, E64, E65, E66 and E90 vehicles, on a customer complaint basis only, refer to the following procedure:<br><br>Update the complete vehicle per SI B09 05 01 (Coding, Individualization, Programming) Procedure B using Progman V24.02.01 or higher.<br><br>The listed handsets do NOT have a software update available to correct the issue. The customer may want to contact their cellular service provider to notify the provider of the problem with their handsets.<br><br>WARRANTY INFORMATION<br>Covered under the terms of the BMW New Vehicle Limited Warranty.<br><br>Defect Code:<span class='indent-20'>&#09;</span>Refer to KSD<br><br>Labor Operation:<span class='indent-20'>&#09;</span>Refer to KSD<br><br>Labor Allowance:<span class='indent-20'>&#09;</span>Refer to KSD<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/12806369.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br></div>
