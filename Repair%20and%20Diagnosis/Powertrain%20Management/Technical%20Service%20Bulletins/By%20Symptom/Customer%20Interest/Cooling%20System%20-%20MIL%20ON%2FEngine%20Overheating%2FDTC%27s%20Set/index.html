Remove both battery cables from the battery for 15 minutes.<br><br>2. After reconnecting the battery cables, clear the vehicle fault memory and ensure that the electric coolant pump operates using the bleeding procedure, described at the end of this bulletin.<br><br><b>PROCEDURE B</b><br><br>This procedure applies to all vehicles with any combination of faults listed below.<br><br>FC 2E81 Electric coolant pump, speed deviation, speed outside the tolerance<br><br>FC 2E82 Electric coolant pump cutoff, over-current<br><br>FC 2E83 Electric coolant pump, power-reduced operation, dry run<br><br>FC 2E84 Electric coolant pump, communication<br><br>FC 2E85 Electric coolant pump, communication, no voltage at emergency operation input of pump<br><br><b>Note:</b><br>All measurements should be performed with the battery charger connected to the vehicle.<br><br>1.

Replace the electric coolant water pump (P/N 11 51 7 546 994) in accordance with Repair Instruction RA 11 51 000.<br><br>3. After performing any service work requiring draining of the coolant, the system must be bled to ensure that there are no air pockets present. The system can be bled using ISTA/D or by following a special procedure. To bleed the system, follow the procedure described at the end of this bulletin.<br><br><b>BLEEDING (VENTING) THE <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">COOLING SYSTEM</a></b><br><br><b>Note:</b><br>BMW recommends filling the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a> for protection against freezing down to -34&deg;F (-37&deg;C); this is an antifreeze ratio of 50% antifreeze and 50% water. In severely cold areas, the antifreeze can be increased to 60%, which provides freezing protection down to -62&deg;F (-52&deg;C).<br><br>Do not exceed a 60% ratio of antifreeze.<br><br>The specified antifreeze ratio is important, since an insufficient amount would impair antifreezing and corrosion-inhibiting protection. An excessive amount would not improve freezing protection, but would instead reduce freezing protection. At all times, the antifreeze and water should be premixed before pouring into the engine. If premixing is not performed, damage will occur to the water pump assembly.<br><br><b>Note:</b><br>Always connect a battery charger while performing the bleeding process.<br><br>1. Fill the system with coolant via the expansion tank (AGB). Top up the coolant level to the lower edge of the expansion tank.<br><br>2. Close the expansion tank.<br><br>3. Switch on the ignition.<br><br>4. Set heating to the maximum (temperature); switch on the blower (lowest stage).<br><br>5. Press the accelerator pedal module to the floor for at least 10 seconds. The engine must NOT be started.<br><br>6. Bleeding via EWP takes approximately 12 minutes. Then check the coolant level in the expansion tank; top up to the MAX marking if necessary.<br><br>7. Check the cooling circuit and drain the plugs for leaks.<br><br>8. If the procedure needs to be repeated several times, allow the DME to completely de-energize (remove the ignition key for approx. 3 minutes) and then repeat the procedure, starting from item 3.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/414964125.png"></div><br><br><br><br>PARTS INFORMATION<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/414965924.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/414969763.png"></div><br><br><br><br>WARRANTY INFORMATION<br></div>
