<h1>Cruise Control</h1> <br><br><b>Multi-function Steering Wheel (MFL) Interface</b><br><br>With the aid of the multi-function steering wheel (MFL), the driver can operate various vehicle functions from the steering wheel. These functions include:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Radio functions<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Telephone functions<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cruise-control system functions<br><br>In addition to a high degree of comfort, the multifunction steering wheel also offers the driver increased safety as it is not necessary to take the hands off the steering wheel to operate various functions. The driver can implement the functions from the multifunction steering wheel without diverting attention from the traffic situation.<br><br>The response times to MFL keystrokes are so fast that no feedback from the vehicle is noticeable.<br><br>The signals for the cruise-control system are sent from the multi-function steering wheel to the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Engine%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">engine control module</a> where they are evaluated. There is no separate control module for the cruise-control system.<br><br><b>Operating the cruise-control system</b><br>A switch block for operation of the cruise-control system is located on the right-hand side of the steering wheel. Description of operating keys from top to bottom:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Resume:</b> The vehicle accelerates or decelerates from non-controlled operation to the driving speed last set and maintains this speed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Accelerate:</b> The speed is increased by <b>1 km/h</b> by briefly hitting this button. If pressed longer, the speed is increased until the button is released again. Cruise control is only switched on, however, if all switch-on conditions are fulfilled.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Decelerate:</b> The driving speed is reduced from the set speed by pressing the "decelerate" button on the steering wheel. The speed is decreased by <b>1 km/h</b> by briefly hitting this button. If pressed longer, the speed is decreased until the button is released again. However, it is not possible for the driving speed to drop below the minimum set speed.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The deceleration function is terminated by a switch-off condition occurring:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Off:</b> switches off the cruise-control system. Switching the ignition lock to position 1 or 2 and actuating the main switch (I/O) places the cruise-control system on standby. The system preparation (arming) prevents inadvertent actuation of the MFL cruise-control system control elements. Cruise-control standby is indicated by an LED in the instrument cluster.<br><br>Switch-on conditions:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>"Accelerate" button in neutral position before switching on cruise control.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The minimum speed of <b>30 km/h</b> must be exceeded.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The brake pedal must be in rest position.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The clutch pedal must be in rest position on vehicles with manual transmissions.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive stage "2" to "D" must be engaged on vehicles with automatic transmissions.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No switch-off condition must be active.<br><br>Faults detected in the cruise-control system are stored in the fault memory of the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Engine%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">engine control module</a>.
