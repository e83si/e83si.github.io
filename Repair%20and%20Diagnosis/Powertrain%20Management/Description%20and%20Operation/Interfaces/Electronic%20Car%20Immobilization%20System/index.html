<h1>Electronic Car Immobilization System</h1> <br><br><b>Control Module Car Access CAS</b><br><br>The CAS serves as an antitheft alarm system and enables the start of BMW vehicles.<br><br>A transponder chip is integrated in each of the vehicle keys. A ring coil is fitted about the ignition lock. The transponder chip is powered by this coil from the CAS control module. This means that no battery is necessary in the key. The power supply and data transfer take place in the same way as a transformer between the loop antenna (coil) at the ignition lock and the transponder chip.<br><br>The key then sends data to the CAS control module. If these data are correct, the CAS control module enables the starter by means of a relay located in the control module and additionally sends a coded start enable signal via a data link to the DME/DDE. These procedures may result in a start delay of up to half a second.<br><br><b>Components</b><br><br><b>Data link to DME/DDE</b><br>The CAS control module sends a coded enable signal to the DME/DDE via the data link. The engine cannot be started before this signal has been transferred.<br><br><b><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Engine%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">Engine control module</a> (DME/DDE) with coded start enable input</b><br>The engine control module (DME/DDE) only enables engine start if a correct enable signal is received from the CAS control module.<br><br><b>EWS-DME/DDE interface</b><br>Identical variable codes are stored in the CAS control module and in the DME/DDE control module. The value of these codes changes after every start procedure. Start enable only takes place if the code sent by the CAS control module agrees with the code calculated in the DME/DDE control module.<br><br>The control modules are allocated only during initial programming of the DME/DDE control module. The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Engine%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">engine control module</a> then adopts the basic code of the CAS control module.<br><br><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  It is not possible to replace the DME/DDE or CAS control modules for test purposes!<br><br>In rare cases, it is possible that the variable codes in both control modules deviate from each other. In these cases, it is possible to reset both codes to the initial value via the service function 'DME(DDE) - CAS matching' (EWS calibration).<br><br><b>Key identification and start procedure</b><br>The following procedure takes place after inserting the vehicle key in the ignition lock:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The transponder in the key is powered via the loop antenna and sends the key data to the CAS control module.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The CAS control module checks the key data to ensure it is correct and only then sends an enable signal to the starter.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The CAS control module sends the variable code to DME/DDE.
