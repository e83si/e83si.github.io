<h1>Plausibility, Accelerator/Brake Pedal</h1> <br><br><b>Simultaneous Operation Of Accelerator And Brake Pedals</b><br><br>This test module serves to detect whether the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Accelerator%2520Pedal/index.html">accelerator pedal</a> mechanically jams or is otherwise difficult to move. This is determined by simultaneously operating the accelerator and brake pedals while the vehicle is being driven.<br><br>The fault is set in the engine management system if a driver's demand is detected via the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Accelerator%2520Pedal/index.html">accelerator pedal</a> for at least <b>1.5 seconds </b>and in relation to this there is a brake signal. Here, the brake pressure is used as a measured variable. This prevents braking deceleration being stopped by a jamming accelerator pedal.<br><br><b>Effect:</b><br>As long as the driver's demand and brake pressure are present, the vehicle does as follows:<br><br>The engine management system reduces the driver's demand relative to the brake pressure. If the brake pressure increases, the driver's demand is taken back accordingly by the engine management system.<br><br>Perceivable effects: like taking foot off <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Accelerator%2520Pedal/index.html">accelerator pedal</a><br><br><b>Possible customer complaint:</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inertia fuel shutoff while driving<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Loss of power output<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Increased, constant engine speed and/or mechanical snagging of <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Accelerator%2520Pedal/index.html">accelerator pedal</a><br><br><b>Requirements of the vehicle for setting the fault:</b><br>Speed &ge; <b>8 kph</b><br><br>No fault entries in the engine management system for the following component groups:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Accelerator pedal module<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Brake light switch<br><br><b>Procedure:</b><br>The accelerator pedal module may only be replaced if there is an express customer complaint regarding increased, constant <a>idle speed</a> and / or a mechanically jamming <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Accelerator%2520Pedal/index.html">accelerator pedal</a> as well as the fault entry.<br><br>The fault entry alone does not require component replacement!<br><br>In the case of a multiple fault entry, the customer is to be informed of his or her possible incorrect operation (simultaneously operating the accelerator and brake pedals).</div>
