<h1>Transmission Selector Switch and Operating Units</h1> <br><br><br><b>Gear selector switch (gear lever)</b><br>The gear selector switch (selector lever) enables the engagement of the individual drive positions or gears (Steptronic). The selector-lever position is transferred to the transmission by means of a cable. The engaged drive position is shown visually via the shift-indicator illumination.<br><br>Vehicles with rocker switches <br>In addition to the sequential gear selection by means of the selector lever, the gears can also be shifted at the steering wheel with 2 rocker switches (vehicle-specific). <br>To upshift, briefly pull one of the two rocker switches. <br>To downshift, briefly press one of the two rocker switches. <br><br><br><b>Brief description of components</b><br>The selector lever is built into the centre console. The selector-lever cover contains the illuminated display for the selector-lever position. The engaged drive position is backlit on the gearshift diagram. The background light is activated by the wiping contact on the selector lever. <br>An interlock prevents inadvertent shifts to selector-lever positions "R" and "P". To cancel the interlock, press the button on the front of the selector lever knob.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/528223692.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><br><b>Index <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Explanation</b><br>1 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Illuminated display for the selector-lever position<br>2 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Selector-lever cover<br>3 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Button<br>4 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Selector lever<br> <br>The selector lever has the positions<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>for parking: enables starting of the engine<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>for reverse gear<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>for neutral: enables starting of the engine <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Towing the vehicle is only possible in this selector-lever position.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>for drive: automatic mode<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Gears are shifted within the framework of the adaptive transmission control.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>"M" for manual operation = Steptronic <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>or "S" <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>for Sport program = automatic mode with sporting characteristic curves<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Manual downshifting<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Manual upshifting<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the selector lever is in the position "M/S", the transmission is in the automatic mode with sports characteristic curves. The display in the instrument cluster change from "D" to "SD". <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the selector lever is now tilted towards "-" or "+" in the gearshift gutter "M/S", the electronics switch to Steptronic. The sustained manual operation via selector lever or rocker switches becomes active. The display in the instrument cluster changes from "SD" to "M1" to "M6".<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In the manual mode, the transmission control only executes upshifts or downshifts with the matching engine speed and road speed. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Gearshifts that would lead to non-permitted high or low engine speeds are not permitted.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The M/S position is notified to the transmission control by the Steptronic switch directly via line (signal name: EGS_MGE or EGS_MGA). The Steptronic switch is integrated in the gear selector switch. The selector-lever settings of the Steptronic for shifting the individual gears up and down are notified to the transmission control directly across a line (signal names: EGS_UP; EGS_Down).<br><br><br><b>System functions</b><br>The following system functions are described:<br><br><b>Parking lock</b><br>The parking lock blocks the transmission output shaft. The vehicle is secured against rolling away. The parking lock is designed in such a way that on upward or downward inclines of up to 32 % a secure hold is always ensured. <br>The parking lock is engaged purely mechanically with the vehicle stationary using the selector lever (Bowden cable from selector lever to the mechatronics module).<br><br><br><b>Shiftlock (selector lever interlock)</b><br>The selector lever is interlocked in the positions "P" and "N" by an electromagnet. The electromagnet is activated by the EGS control module. <br>The selector lever interlock is engaged when selector-lever position "P" or "N" is detected and the ignition (terminal 15) is ON.<br><br>A position change from selector-lever position "P" or "N" is only possible at a driving speed below 5 kph and when the brake is operated at an engine speed below 2500 rpm.<br><br><br><b>Interlock (withdrawal lock)</b><br>Vehicles with ignition lock and ignition key (E83)<br>The ignition lock is mechanically connected to the selector lever via a Bowden cable. The withdrawal lock only permits the ignition key to be removed in selector-lever position "P". <br>Vice versa, the selector lever can only be moved from selector-lever position "P" when the ignition key is inserted and turned to at least ignition ON.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/528085081.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Index <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Explanation<br>1 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  EGS control module integrated in the mechatronics module<br>2 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Instrument cluster (KOMBI)<br>3 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Electronic immobilizer (EWS)<br>4 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Digital Engine Electronics (DME)<br>5 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Display of the selector-lever position with gearshift diagram in the selector-lever cover<br>6 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Bowden cable for withdrawal lock of the ignition lock<br>7 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Ignition lock with withdrawal lock (interlock)<br>8 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Selector lever<br>9 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Bowden cable for gear position switch with transmission position sensor and parking lock<br>PT-CAN <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Powertrain CAN<br><br><br>Vehicles with insert compartment and remote control<br>The selector lever is interlocked in the selector-lever position "P" at terminal 15 OFF. If the remote control is not located in the insert compartment, the selector lever is interlocked in position "P". <br>The electromagnet is supplied with current by the EGS control module to release the selector lever as of terminal 15. A micro-switch picks up the interlocking or release of the selector lever. The micro-switch sends the signal to the CAS (Car Access System) to release the remote control.<br><br>Withdrawal lock without comfort access<br>If selector-lever position "P" is not engaged, the remote control cannot be withdrawn from the insert compartment. In selector-lever position ï¿½Pï¿½ and with ignition OFF, the selector lever is interlocked once again.
