For this reason, we have published this BMW Technical Service bulletin to provide a uniform storage concept, which will prevent damage being caused due to incorrect storage.<br>The tire's rubber will age under the influence of sunlight, heat, humidity, movements in the air and ozone, and will thus lose some of its stability and elasticity. For this reason, <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a> should never be stored in the open-air. If open-air storage cannot be avoided, the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> / tires must be stored in a clean and dry condition and covered with waterproof material. It is essential that wheels / tires are protected against rain, snow and sunlight, but due to the risk of corrosion they must not be stored in tire sacks. For more information on protective covers for <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/">wheels and tires</a>, <br>see SI 36 01 88 (864).<br><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">Wheels</a> / <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a> with tire pressure control (RDC) must not be cleaned with high-pressure cleaning equipment. For general information on RDC, see SI 36 02 98 (377).<br><b>Storage requirements</b><br>The following requirements apply in general to storage in enclosed rooms:<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/251099520.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br>In short, the storage room should be cool and dry. It is not necessary to heat the room during the winter. In the summer, the doors and windows should be kept closed to ensure that no air can circulate. In addition, the windows can also be coated with sun protection paint. <br>The storage room should not contain any working electric machinery, welding equipment, distribution boxes etc. as electrical sparks generate ozone which can have a serious impact on the surface of the tire (ozone cracks).<br><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">Tires</a> should not be allowed to come into contact with oil, petrol, or other mineral lubricants as these dissolve rubber, making the tire porous.<br><b>Preparing <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> / <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a></b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Before removing a wheel, mark its position on the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Whenever possible, keep the tire on its wheel (complete <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a>).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Correct the inflation pressure and recheck every 2 months.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a> are stored at a sufficient distance above the ground. <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">Wheels</a> / tires should never be stored on the ground. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Complete the storage forms.
