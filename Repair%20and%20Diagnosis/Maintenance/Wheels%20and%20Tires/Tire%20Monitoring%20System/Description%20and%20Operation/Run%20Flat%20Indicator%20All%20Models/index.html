If the pressure in one of the tires should drop, the tire will gradually "cave in". The resulting flexing means that the defective tire will quickly receive additional damage. The tire could burst.<br>Some 80% of all flat <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a> are caused by small holes (e.g. caused by nails). The holes result in a gradual loss of pressure in the affected tire. Many "tire blowouts" can be traced back to preliminary damage caused by a gradual loss of pressure.<br>A gradual loss of pressure in one tire may remain unnoticed for a long time. The lack of pressure only makes itself clearly felt when driving when the tire is almost completely empty.<br>As tire pressure drops, the radius of the wheel and with it the tire's rolling circumference will also decrease. The upshot is that the wheel speed of the affected tire is increased. <br>The RPA records the wheel speeds using the wheel-speed sensors of the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). The RPA compares the speeds of the individual <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> and computes an average speed. In this way the RPA is able to detect a loss of tire pressure.<br>The RPA detects a drop in pressure below about 30% &plusmn; 10% of the initial value. The RPA indicator and warning light indicates a drop in tire pressure. The RPA will indicate this after just a short distance, as a rule after a few minutes, from a certain minimum speed (e.g. 25 km/h) up to the permissible top speed.<br><br>> - Different control units for the Run Flat Indicator  <br>> - E46 All-wheel drive [system overview ...]<br>> - E46, E53, E83, E85, E86 [system overview ...]<br>> - E60, E61, E63, E64 [system overview ...]<br>> - E65, E66 [system overview ...]<br>> - E70 [system overview ...]<br>> - E87, E90, E91, E92, E93 [system overview ...]<br>> - R56 [system overview ...]<br><br>Despite coming from different manufacturers the systems hardly differ from one model series to the next in the way they appear to the driver (initialization, RPA indicator and warning light, characteristics, diagnosis).<br><br><b>Important: Responsibility resides with the driver at all times</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Check tire pressures regularly, at least twice a month and before embarking on lengthy journeys. <br>During initialization, the set tire pressure is taken as the initial value for the current set of <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a>. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If all 4 <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a> loose pressure at the same rate, the wheel speeds will also change at the same rate.

A fault in the RPA is indicated by the RPA indicator and warning light and by a symbol in the LCD display.<br><br> <br><br><b>Initialization</b><br>Initialization is started manually (e.g. by pressing the RPA button). Once it has been started, initialization will continue through to complete calibration. This process may be interrupted any number of times.<br>It is important that the vehicle is driven away immediately after initialization is started. The system will not start calibration until the vehicle is driven away. Even a terminal change will not change this. <br>In principle, calibration is only possible while the vehicle is being driven (road speeds above 25 km/h).<br>Initialization will run as a fully automatic calibration sequence (after the journey has started). In other words, the circumference of individual <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a> are recorded and evaluated.<br><br>To allow a drop in tire pressure to be detected, the system considers different speed ranges and driving situations. Taking account of the driving situation means that the system has to be primed for each speed range individually. <br>From 09/04 (starting with E87), these speed ranges and driving situations have been combined into 3 calibration ranges. This means greater clarity for output via the BMW diagnosis systems Group Tester One (GT1) and DISplus. <br>The initialization phase lasts approx. 5 to 15 minutes for the individual speed ranges. The end of the initialization phase is not indicated.<br>A visual and acoustic warning can only be emitted in the speed ranges that have been calibrated by at least 67 percent.<br>The calibration process can be delayed by:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>dynamic driving<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>a road with lots of bends<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>frequent changes in load (only on vehicles with electronic height control -> air spring/height control regulation)<br><br> <br><br><b>Detects drop in tire pressure</b><br>The RPA records the wheel speeds using the wheel-speed sensors from the DSC.

In this way the RPA is able to detect a loss of tire pressure. (In the event of a tire losing pressure, the tire rolling circumference of the affected tire is also reduced.)<br><br> <br><br><b>Visual and acoustic warning</b><br>A drop in pressure in one tire of approx. 30% &plusmn; 10% from the initial value is indicated by the RPA indicator and warning light. In addition, an acoustic signal sounds. <br>Signal output: Depending on the model concerned, either via the instrument cluster or the multi-audio system controller (M-ASK) / Car Communication Computer (CCC).<br><br><b>Note: DSC malfunction</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The sensors used by the RPA are all monitored by the DSC.

The body will then assume a slightly inclined attitude. As soon as the flat tire has been repaired and the RPA reinitialized, the inclined attitude will be levelled out again.
