<h1>1. Foreword</h1><br><br><br><br><b>1. Foreword</b><br><br><b>1.1 Objectives</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Wheel alignment has become an increasingly complex subject. The aim of this BMW Service Technology bulletin, therefore, is to achieve several objectives: <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Creation of guidelines for working with the BMW Kinematic Diagnosis System (KDS).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Familiarisation with wheel alignment technology for current vehicles and clarifying any questions which arise in this connection.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Transparency and clarification of different terms.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Clarification of the causes of errors in the past, such that they can be avoided after reading this document.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Creation of conditions for dealing safely with the BMW KDS.<br><br><b>1.2 Further development of the BMW Kinematic Diagnosis System</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- The BMW Kinematic Diagnosis System is an integrated part of automotive system concepts. It ensures that work is carried out in a particularly rational manner which is appropriate for BMW requirements, such that you can also be certain of being prepared for future technological developments. As far as precision and performance in wheel alignment and tuning is concerned, BMW, together with leading manufacturers, has made the best of what is technically feasible: the BMW Kinematic Diagnosis System.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- The BMW Kinematic Diagnosis System manufactured by Beissbarth is more than just the further development of conventional wheel alignment equipment. It sets new standards in precision, performance, speed and handling. It is a guarantor for the perfection which BMW service customers rely on. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Ride comfort, road safety and tyre wear depend to a large extent on the perfect interplay of the vehicle's kinematic functions. BMW is constantly launching new generations of chassis which are even better than their predecessors. This is why there are fewer kinematics system adjusting points and narrower tolerances when measuring and tuning the chassis.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- With the use of the multi-link rear suspension and the E36, the electronic wheel alignment devices are no longer suitable for BMW wheel alignment purposes. This applies to both the measuring procedure and measuring precision. The generation of equipment which was approved with the E36 series still fulfils all the requirements placed on a modern wheel alignment device, including the use of the latest computer technology.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Only BMW Kinematic Diagnosis Systems manufactured by Beissarth and Bosch may be used for wheel alignment.<br><br><b>1.3 Technical Data</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/205793432.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/205881945.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><b>1.4 Scope of delivery</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1 - PC display device with graphic screen, graphical tablet, small or large equipment cabinet including automatic charging station, DIN A4 dot matrix printer<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4 - Measuring sensors with CCD camera technology and infrared data transmission with built-in power supply<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1 - Cable set (comprising 4 cables)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1 - Brake clamping device<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1 - Steering lock device<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2 - Electronic precision rotating plates with integrated sensor without access ramps<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2 - Sliding plates without access ramps<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4 - BMW quick-clamping units, comprising a P8-68 locating bell and P267 01 quick-acting clamp including coated holding claws<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1 - Operating instructions for BMW KDS (8 languages)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1 - BMW software and the BMW vehicle setpoint data with setting screens as well as text for the measurement preparations<br><br><b>1.5 Accessories required</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2 - Locating rods for positioning the vehicle<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1 - Set of sand bags for the prescribed loading<br><br><b>1.6 Accessories recommended</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4 - Quick-clamping units<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2 - Sets of access ramps<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1 - Remote control / display<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1 - Trolley (for ballast bags, rotating and sliding plates and 4 quick-acting clamps)<br></div>
