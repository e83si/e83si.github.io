The fuel pump must always be able to generate a higher <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Tune-up%2520and%2520Engine%2520Performance%2520Checks/Fuel%2520Pressure/index.html">fuel pressure</a> than the pressure regulated by the pressure regulator.<br>The injection rate is adjusted by means of the injection time; the injection time is controlled by the DME.<br><br><b>Description of operation: fuel return line</b><br>When the engine is at a standstill and the ignition key is in position 0, the fuel return line after the pressure regulator is at zero pressure.<br><br><b>Description of operation: pressure retaining function</b><br>The pressure regulator closes when the engine is at a standstill and the ignition key is in position 0.

A non-return valve closes in the fuel pump. These measures help to retain the fuel pressure in the fuel system.
