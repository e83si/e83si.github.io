<h1>Rear Window Wiping/Washing (X Series_X3-E83)</h1> <br><br><br><b>Rear Window Wiper</b><br><br>The rear window can be cleaned and wiped with the rear wiper/washer system. The system is controlled by a separate control module that forms one module together with the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Motor/index.html">wiper motor</a>.<br><br><b>Operation</b><br><br><b>Rear window wiper</b><br>Terminal R must be switched on to enable the "rear window wipe" function. The rear window wiper is switched on by pressing forward the wipe/wash switch to the first switch stage (in forward direction). The rear window wiper then runs at a fixed wipe interval.<br><br>An electronic switch (Hall sensor) is integrated in the rear window wiper for the purpose of detecting the park position<br><br><b>Rear window wash function</b><br>The "rear window wash" function is activated by momentarily pressing the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Switch/index.html">wiper switch</a> or by pressing it beyond the "rear window wipe" position.<br><br>Following activation, a wash program is triggered that consists of three wash cycles and two wipe cycles. Renewed activation is possible during the last wipe cycle. The wash pump is activated by the control module for the rear window wiper.<br><br><b>Programmable wipe intervals</b><br>The interval time of the rear window wiper can be programed as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition lock in position 1 or 2 (terminal R ON)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Switch/index.html">wiper switch</a> forward to the first switch position, the rear window wiper is activated.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pull back <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Switch/index.html">wiper switch</a> to "rear window wiper OFF" position before the wipe cycle is completed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wait for the required interval time to elapse and switch on the rear window wiper. The time between switch OFF and switch ON is stored as the interval time.<br><br>The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Switch/index.html">wiper switch</a> must not be set in the "rear window wash" position when programming the interval time.<br><br>A maximum interval time of <b>30 seconds</b> can be programed.<br><br><b>Special functions</b><br><br><b>Open rear window</b><br>The rear window wiper is switched off when the rear window is open. After closing the rear window, the rear window wiper is not switched on again before it is switched off and on at the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Switch/index.html">wiper switch</a> or before terminal R is switched off and on.<br><br>The rear window contact is connected directly to the control module for the rear window wiper.

A jamming situation is detected by the Hall sensor integrated in the wiper motor and by an internal short-circuit detection facility in the electronic components. The wiper is switched off if jamming is detected.</div>
