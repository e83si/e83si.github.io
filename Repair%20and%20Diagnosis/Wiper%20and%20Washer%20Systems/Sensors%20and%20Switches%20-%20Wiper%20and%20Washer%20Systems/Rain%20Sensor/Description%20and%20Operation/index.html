<h1>Rain Sensor: Description and Operation</h1> <br><br><br><b>Rain / Driving Light Sensor</b><br><br>The rain-driving light sensor has integrated sensors that sense the wetness on the windshield glass and the ambient light.<br><br><b><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Rain%2520Sensor/index.html">Rain sensor</a></b><br>The rain sensor is an optical system. It consists of an optical element bonded on the windshield and an electronic element. The electronic evaluation unit and 4 optical transmitter and receiver diodes are integrated in the electronic element.<br><br><b>Function</b><br>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Rain%2520Sensor/index.html">rain sensor</a> is activated when the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Switch/index.html">wiper switch</a> is moved to the first stop position.<br><br>When the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Rain%2520Sensor/index.html">rain sensor</a> is activated, visual feedback is given to the driver in that one wiping cycle is executed first. Then, the transmitter diodes emit an infrared light which is guided across the optical element to the windshield. If the windshield is completely dry and clean, the infrared light is fully reflected to the receiver diodes.<br><br>If there is water or dirt in the area of the optical element on the windshield, full reflection of the infrared light is no longer possible. Part of the light penetrates the windshield so that only part of the light arrives at the receiver diodes. The electronic circuitry detects how much water is on the windshield on the basis of the amount of light that is being blocked out and send a signal to that effect via the K bus. The ZKE basic module then performs a wipe cycle. In the case of very heavy rain, the intermittent operation goes into stage 1 or stage 2 of the continuous wiping mode.<br><br>A heating element integrated in the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Rain%2520Sensor/index.html">rain sensor</a> prevents misting of the optical element or the diodes.<br><br>The sensitivity of the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Rain%2520Sensor/index.html">rain sensor</a> can be varied in 4 sensitivity stages by means of the knurled wheel on the wiper/washer switch.
