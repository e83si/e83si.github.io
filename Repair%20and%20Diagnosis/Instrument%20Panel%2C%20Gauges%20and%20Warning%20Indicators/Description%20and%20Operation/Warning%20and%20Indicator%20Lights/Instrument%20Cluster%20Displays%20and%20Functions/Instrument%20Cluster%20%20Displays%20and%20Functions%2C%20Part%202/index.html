<h1>Instrument Cluster  Displays and Functions, Part 2</h1> <br><br><b>Digital clock</b><br>With terminal R On, the first display that appears is the Service Interval Display (SIA) for <b>5 seconds</b> in display 1. During this period, operations of the axial button in the steering column lever (LSS) for turn indicators are ignored. The time is then displayed. The time can be adjusted using the S/R button and the clock symbol button on the instrument cluster as well as via the on-board computer. A clock that has not been set, e.g. after a longer power interruption of terminal 30, is indicated by dashes with a flashing colon.<br><br>As of terminal R, the time is sent on the K bus for display on the Multi Information Radio (MIR) or Central Information Display (CID).<br><br>Depending on coding, the time can be displayed in the <b>12 hour</b> or <b>24 hour</b> mode. It is changed over by pressing the axial button in the steering-column lever (LSS) for turn indicators for a longer period (> <b>5 seconds</b>). The <b>12 hour</b> setting is displayed by activating AM and PM.<br><br><b>Setting the clock with the S/R and clock symbol buttons:</b><br>To call up the setting mode:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>press the clock symbol button for longer than <b>5 seconds</b>.

It is now possible to issue the seat-belt warning by fitting belt buckles that have so far only been used in US vehicles. In addition, the seat occupation detection (SBE) detects whether the passenger's seat is occupied. After a travel distance of <b>100 meters</b> or during a trip, the instrument cluster issues an intermittent acoustic warning for a maximum of <b>90 seconds</b>.<br><br>The seatbelt buckle information is transferred by the airbag control module across the K bus to the instrument cluster.<br><br><b>Predrive check</b><br>The pre-drive check is described in the functional description of the instrument cluster: internal test functions, service interval display (SIA), measures for replacing control modules<br><br><b>On-board computer functions</b><br>The on-board computer function in the instrument cluster can be coded in two versions.<br><br>In the low version for on-board computer, only the outside temperature is displayed in LC display area 1.

The sensor is connected to the power supply of the instrument cluster. The analog voltage value coming from the sensor is digitized in the instrument cluster. Then, depending on the engine temperature and travelling speed, it is processed for the display.<br><br>When the outside temperature is displayed, the unit display can be changed. Pressing the axial button in the steering-column lever (LSS) for turn indicators for a longer period (> <b>5 seconds</b>) switches the unit from  <b>degree C</b> to <b>degree F</b> and vice versa.<br><br>As of terminal R On, the display can be changed using the axial button in the steering-column lever (LSS) for turn indicators. The order is: time of day, outside temperature, average fuel consumption, cruising range, average vehicle speed. Each time the axial button in the steering-column lever (LSS) for turn indicator is released, a jump is made to the next function.<br><br>If the outside temperature falls below <b>+3 degrees C</b>, an acoustic outside-temperature warning is issued.

In the case of the automatic transmission version and sequential M-transmission (SMG), the engaged gear and selected transmission program are displayed in LC display area 2. In the event of a fault, the transmission emergency program symbol is displayed in a separate indicator lamp. The display function can be coded. The coded function (without, automatic, SMG) is displayed as of terminal 15 On.<br><br><b>Program mode (left)</b><br><b>M</b> (= manual)<br><b>S</b> (= Sport)<br><b>D</b> (= automatic mode, only SMG)<br><b>F</b> (= fault, only SMG)<br><br><b>Gear (right)</b><br><b>P</b><br><b>R</b><br><b>N</b><br><b>D</b><br><b>1</b> to <b>6</b><br><br>The SMG display can also be displayed after terminal 15 R Off as long as the SMG control module transmits information. In addition, the SMG can flash the display and issue an acoustic warning via the PT CAN bus.<br><br>In the case of automatic transmission and SMG, the transmission information is transmitted from the transmission control module across the PT CAN bus. The data received by the instrument cluster is displayed as of terminal 15 On. A fault in the transmission or failure of the PT CAN communication triggers display of the transmission emergency program with a separate indicator lamp. The function can be coded. If the message fails, a fault memory entry is made in the instrument cluster.<br><br>On manual transmission vehicles, the reverse gear signal is read in via connector pins. In order to enable output of the reversing signal across the K bus also in the case of manual transmissions, there is a digital input for this signal on the instrument cluster. If the instrument cluster is coded for a manual transmission, it reads the information via the input. The current status "Reverse gear engaged" is always provided across the K bus to other equipment attached to the bus such as mirror memory, Park Distance Control (PDC), etc.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  In the case of SMG, selector-lever position N flashes after the vehicle has been parked. Flashing is the visual indication of the possibility that the vehicle might roll.<br><br><b>Notes for Service department</b><br>Test functions: The test functions serve to check the coding and to run troubleshooting without the diagnosis tester.
