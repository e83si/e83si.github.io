<h1>Emergency Running Systems</h1><br><b>Emergency running systems</b><br><br><b>Introduction</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Tyres with emergency running characteristics can still be used for a certain distance even if they suffer a complete loss of pressure. There are two different systems which meet these requirements:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>emergency running system with self-supporting tyres<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>emergency running system with integrated support ring<br><br><br><b>Emergency running systems setup</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Emergency running system with self-supporting tyres</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The side walls of the self-supporting tyre are reinforced. In conjunction with a special disc wheel the tyre can still be used for a certain distance even if it suffers a complete loss of pressure.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Mobility is retained for the following distances up ton speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) nod with a cautious suitably adapted driving style:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Unloaded vehicle <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span> <b>max. 500 km (300 miles)</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Unloaded roadster <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span> <b>less than 250km (150 miles)</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fully loaded vehicle <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span> <b>max. 50 km (30 miles)</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Self-supporting tyres demand permanent monitoring of the tyre pressure to ensure that the driver is given adequate warning if pressure is lost during a journey. For this reason these tyres are only available in conjunction with the warning system RDW and from 03/2000 also with RDC.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To prevent the self-supporting tyres from becoming detached from the disc wheel in the event of a complete loss of tyre pressure they must be fitted to newly developed <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> with modified disc wheel humps but with unchanged tyre seating (standard disc wheel).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>However the new <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> can also be used for standard tyres of the same size.<br></div>
