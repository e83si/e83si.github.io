Turn the ignition to position 1 (terminal R).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Do not cycle the key or perform diagnosis while installing the new software. Make sure that the power supply is stable, i.e., do not switch on any electrical loads.<br><br>2. Activate "GPS-Navigation" and acknowledge the screen disclaimer by pushing the rotary knob on the board monitor.<br><br>3. Remove the map CD from the navigation computer by pressing the "Eject" button.<br><br>4. Insert the navigation software CD (V17.1 P/N 01 59 9 789 299 index "x" for Mk III without the split screen; V32 P/N 01 59 0 141 891 index "y" for all other versions).<br><br>5. Mark I System (up to 9/97 production):<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>After a few seconds, the BMW roundel will appear on the board monitor and will be "filled in" clockwise to show the progress of loading (approx. 4-6 minutes).<br><br>Mark II System (from 9/97 production)<br><br>Mark III System (E46 from 06/00 and E38, E39, and E52 from 09/00 production) <br><br>DVD-Top navigation system (E46, E39, E52 from 09/02 and E53, E85 from 10/02 production):<br><br>After a few seconds, a menu of notes on the loading procedure and the "Progress" bar appear on the board monitor.<br><br>When the loading process has been completed, the message "Software has been successfully loaded" is displayed.<br><br>6. Remove the navigation system operating software CD and confirm the end of the loading process by pressing the rotary knob on the board monitor. "OK" appears in the display.<br><br>7. Drive the vehicle before delivering it to the customer to ensure that the navigation system is functioning and displaying (interstate icons) correctly.<br><br><b>LOADING SOFTWARE (E65 AND E66 ONLY)</b><br><br>[NEW]When programming any E65 or E66, the "BMW navigation CD" must be loaded prior to programming the vehicle.<br><br><b>Note:</b><br>Connect an approved battery charger before loading the software.<br><br>1. Turn the ignition on to Terminal R or 15.<br><br>2. Enter the navigation menu.<br><br>3. Remove the NAVTEQ road map CD/DVD.<br><br>4. [NEW] Insert the navigation operating software CD V32 (P/N 01 59 0 141 891 index "y") into the navigation computer and use the latest ISTA/P version.<br><br>5. Select "Yes" with the controller to install the software.<br><br>6. The software will then load in two steps, taking approximately 10-15 minutes.<br><br>7. Do not touch the iDrive while the software is loading.<br><br>8. When the installation is finished, the CD will be ejected. The message "Installation Successful, Remove Software loading CD and press OK" will appear. At this point, select "OK" with the controller.<br><br>9. The navigation system will then "Reinitialized".<br><br>10. When prompted, insert the NAVTEQ road map CD/DVD.<br><br>11. [NEW] Refer to SI B09 05 01 (New Programming and Coding System: ISTA/P) for any necessary coding and programming. Note that ISTA/P will automatically reprogram all programmable <a>control units</a> that do not have the latest software.<br><br>12. Drive the vehicle before delivering it to the customer to ensure that the navigation system is functioning and displaying (interstate icons) correctly.<br><br><b>NAVIGATION COMPUTER REPLACEMENT - MK III AND DVD NAV<br><br>[NEW] When replacing a defective MK III or DVD NAV computer, a configuration signal is required to allow the new computer to load the correct software for its respective application. This is generated by using the iSSS (Software Service Station) loaded with the latest ISTA/P version, and the navigation system operating software CD V17.1 or V32.<br><br>1. Connect the Deutronic battery charger to the vehicle.<br><br>2. Connect the SSS via a diagnostic head or an O(P)PS (for D-CAN vehicles) to the vehicle.<br><br>3. Open a "New session in Progman; select "Load SW" and follow the on-screen messages.<br><br>4. Select "Retrofits".<br><br>5. Select "Languages".<br><br>6. First select "Display" to select and/or check the correct languages.<br><br>7. Then select "Navigation" to select the languages for the NAV system.<br><br>8. At the prompt "Is the CD-ROM present?" select "Yes", but do not insert the navigation CD into the Nav Computer yet!<br><br>9. First select the main language and then an additional language (the choices are English, French, Italian, Spanish, and German).<br><br>10. NOTE:</b> The gender of the announcer's voice (male or female) can no longer be selected.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>MKI, MK II & MK III: Only male.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>DVD-Top NAV, NAVI01, NAVI02 and NAVI03: Only female.<br><br>11. After activation of the automatic coding, the DIS tester tells you to follow the instructions on the monitor for navigation CD installation.<br><br>12. Place the navigation CD into the navigation computer CD drive.<br><br><b>Important:</b><br>Do not switch the ignition OFF during the software loading procedure.<br><br>13. Once the loading has been completed, remove the CD and then confirm  completion by pressing the rotary push button on the monitor.<br><br>14. Turn the ignition OFF for 10 seconds, and then turn it ON and conduct a functional check.<br><br>15. After this step has been finished, encode the navigation computer in the regular manner, using the path "1 Recoding".<br><br><b>TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS</b><br><br>The following problems may occur during the software loading procedure:<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The message "CD defective" appears on the display screen.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The message "Fault during programming" appears on the display screen.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The message "The system is restarting" appears on the display screen.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The installation process has stopped; the display screen is blank; and the power LED on the navigation computer is off The CD will not eject.<br><br>These complaints are usually the result of a faulty navigation operating software CD.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>For points 1-3 (error messages that appear on the display screen), check for the correct software version and try loading a new navigation CD.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>For a CD that will not eject from the navigation computer, follow the procedure below:<br><br>1. Remove the navigation computer.<br><br>2. Unplug the voltage supply (blue connector).<br><br>3. Reconnect the voltage supply, and immediately press the eject button repeatedly until the CD in the drive is ejected.<br><br>4.
