<h1>Body - Windshield Damage Analysis</h1>SI B51 35 08<br>Body Equipment<br><br>January 2009<br>Technical Service<br><br>SUBJECT<br>Cracked or Damaged Windshields<br><br>MODEL<br>All models<br><br>SITUATION<br>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Windows%20and%20Glass/Windshield/">windshield</a> may become cracked or damaged for a variety of reasons. While the windshield requires repair or replacement, it is important to take note of the following guidelines regarding what types of damage may or may not be covered by the BMW New Vehicle Warranty.<br><br>CAUSE<br><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Windows%20and%20Glass/Windshield/">Windshield</a> damage is typically caused by one of the following:<br><br>1.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Outside influence  typically stone chips in nearly all cases<br><br>2.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Excessive force applied  such as levering out the A-pillar trim<br><br>3.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Stress crack  due to heavy torsional loads on the vehicle's body or an incorrectly-fitted <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Windows%20and%20Glass/Windshield/">windshield</a> (least common cause)<br><br>PROCEDURE<br><br>When evaluating a cracked or damaged <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Windows%20and%20Glass/Windshield/">windshield</a> to determine whether it is eligible to be claimed under warranty, it is necessary to determine the root cause of the damage. Reviewing the following possible causes will help to determine the root cause.<br><br>Outside Influence<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>An outside influence is responsible for the damage if:<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>One or more chips are present on the outside of the glass along the crack;<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>A crack started from anywhere other than an outside edge.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Run a non-permanent felt tip pen or small marker over the length of the damaged area. Even very minor surface damage will be felt.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Often when a small stone chip occurs, the subsequent crack takes time to develop, as the vehicle is subject to normal torsional loads or temperature fluctuations.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Any damage due to an outside influence will not be covered under warranty.<br><br>Excessive force<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>A <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Windows%20and%20Glass/Windshield/">windshield</a> may become damaged due to excessive force being applied while performing other repairs, such as levering out the A-pillar trim or removing a rear view mirror.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Windows%20and%20Glass/Windshield/">windshield</a> is damaged as a result of excessive force being applied, warranty consideration will not be given.<br><br>Stress crack<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Under very isolated circumstances, a stress crack may form due to a combination of glass position and heavy torsional loads on the body of the vehicle.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>These cracks always start from an outside edge of the glass.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Most often the cracks begin at one of the corners of the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Windows%20and%20Glass/Windshield/">windshield</a>.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Stress cracks typically occur within the first year or 10,000 miles of the vehicle's service life.<br><br><b>Additional Notes</b>:<br><br>Only OEM BMW windshields may be considered for a warranty claim where a stress crack is the root cause. If a non BMW <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Windows%20and%20Glass/Windshield/">windshield</a> was installed in the vehicle, any resulting damage (i.e., cracks, water leaks, etc.) will not be covered. BMW windshields can be identified by a BMW Roundel stamped on the glass in one of the lower corners.<br><br>If the damage to the glass is due to an outside influence, very often the glass can be repaired as opposed to being replaced.
