<h1>Universal Charging and Hands-Free Unit (ULF)</h1> <br><br><br><b>Universal Charging And Hands-Free Unit (ULF)</b><br><br>The universal charging and hands-free unit is intended for the connection of mobile phones with Bluetooth capability to the hands-free unit and the control elements of the vehicle.<br><br><b>Component description</b><br><br><b>Control module</b><br>The control module forms the central component of the system. It consists of the electronics for communication between the Bluetooth mobile phone and the vehicle.<br><br><b>Bluetooth antenna</b><br>The Bluetooth antenna is connected to the control module. The Bluetooth transmit/receive stage is located in the control module.<b><br><br>Microphone</b><br>The analog microphone is connected to the control module of the universal charging and hands-free unit.<br><br><b>Mounting plate</b><br>The mounting plate is located in the center console and serves to set up the electrical connection between the vehicle and various snap-in adapters. The mounting plate contains the 'push to talk' button for accepting calls.<br><br><b>Snap-in adapter</b><br>The snap-in adapter sets up the electrical connection between the mounting plate and the mobile phone. The snap-in adapter implements the power supply for the mobile phone and the antenna connection of the mobile phone to the vehicle. Snap-in adapters are available for a number of mobile phone models with bluetooth capability.<br><br><b>Main functions</b><br><br><b>Connection of ULF mobile phone</b><br>So that the universal charging and hands-free unit is ready for operation, each mobile phone involved must be connected to the ULF at least once. To this end, the ULF must be placed in the "Setup mode" (press and hold the push-to-talk key on the mobile phone cradle while terminal R is switched on; release key after approx. <b>2 seconds</b>). The identification mode can also be activated in the BMW diagnosis system at 'control-module functions'. When the three LEDs on the on-board monitor/MID flash, the universal charging and hands-free unit is in the identification mode. The linking process can now be carried out via the mobile phone menu. When setting up the connection, the bluetooth code of the universal charging and hands-free unit must be entered. The identification mode is closed when terminal R is switched off. The next time terminal R is switched on, the ULF is in the normal operating mode. Only now is the bluetooth connection between the vehicle and mobile phone set up for operation and hands-free mode of the mobile phone via the vehicle.<br><br><b>Prioritization of the connected telephones</b><br>Up to 4 bluetooth mobile phones can be connected to the universal charging and hands-free unit. If a number of telephones are located in the reception range of the universal charging and hands-free unit, the last mobile phone logged on to the ULF is connected. To prioritize a mobile phone, the link between the relevant mobile phone and the ULF must be set up again.<br><br><b>WARNING:  If four mobile phones are already logged in, the first mobile phone logged in to the ULF is deleted. This mobile phone has to be logged in again.</b><br><br><b>Bluetooth code</b><br>The first time a mobile phone with Bluetooth capability is connected to the universal charging and hands-free unit, the Bluetooth Code of the universal charging and hands-free unit must be entered once to set up a connection at the mobile phone. The bluetooth code can be found in the operating manual. It can also be read out with the BMW diagnosis system in the control-module functions and appears on a label on the control module.<br><br><b>Replacement of the universal charging and hands-free unit</b><br>Replacing the universal charging and hands-free unit also changes the bluetooth code. The new bluetooth code is located on the sheet enclosed with the control module and must be attached to the operating manual of the vehicle.<br><br><b>Emergency number</b><br>To send an emergency call, the emergency number 112 is stored in the universal charging and hands-free unit.</div>
