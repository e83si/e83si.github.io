<h1>Troubleshooting/Concept Related Behaviors</h1><b>TROUBLESHOOTING<br><br>Technical limitations of the USB audio interface</b><br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The connected USB device is not recognized and cannot be selected as an entertainment source. This is with the USB device connected at vehicle start-up, or if the USB device is connected with the ignition on (KL15):<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Not all USB devices are compatible with option 6FL or option 6NL. Please refer to the latest list of compatible and/or recommended USB devices. www.bmw.com/com/en/owners/navigation/audio/usb_audio.html<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>For diagnosis of the USB audio interface connection, please refer to SI B65 07 08.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A track cannot be played and/or is skipping:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The file has an invalid format (not mp3, wma or aac), is corrupt, or protected by Digital Rights Management (DRM).<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Playlists, genres, artists, albums and tracks on USB devices are not displayed:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Only Roman text characters are supported. Other character sets (Greek, Japanese, etc.) cannot be displayed.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Time period differs for playlists, genres, artists, albums and tracks on USB devices are displayed:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The time period for playlists, genres, artists, albums and tracks on USB devices to be displayed depends upon the number of audio files on the final device. In the case of a device with 80GB storage and 15,000 audio files, for example, this could take several hours.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The iPod cant be fully operated through the vehicle audio system (affects only option 6FL):<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>For use of an Apple iPod, it is recommended to use the "Adapter cable for Apple iPod" (Y-cable). If the Apple iPod is connected using the USB connector cable supplied with the iPod, the iPod is activated as a USB MSC device. This is only possible if the iPod has been configured accordingly, using iTunes, and formatted using an FAT file system (Windows systems only, not Mac). In addition, no access to the playlists is possible in this operating mode and the DRM-protected audio files cannot be played.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Distortions through the audio system when the device is connected to the cigar lighter for charging:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>There are malfunctions and audio interference, if a device is connected to both the USB connector and the 12V socket. Depending on the model, the USB devices may be supplied with power by the USB connector itself. This means that no additional power connection is required, nor is one recommended.<br><br>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>USB hard drive is not working correctly:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Trouble-free operation of USB hard drives cannot be guaranteed. The power supply of the USB is not sufficient for most hard drives. Audio interference may also occur. The use of hard drives is neither supported nor recommended.<br><br>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>iPod 3rd Generation is not working:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>iPods of the 3rd generation are not supported.<br><br>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With the CCC head unit, the browsing history is not stored. For example, if the list of artists is browsed and an artist is selected, the cursor will appear at the beginning when returning to the artists list.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Normal operation.<br><br>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There are malfunctions if a mobile phone is connected to the USB Audio Interface and paired with the Bluetooth hands-free system:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Some mobile phones deactivate Bluetooth if connected to USB.<br><br><b>Concept related behaviors</b><br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Intermittent inability to select and/or activate categories such as playlists, genres, artists, albums, and tracks after starting the vehicle with the USB device already connected. This occurs if very few audio files (less than 70) are stored on the USB device:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Disconnect and/or reconnect the USB device, or store more audio files.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Message "Reading data" is permanently displayed:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Make a new selection; disconnect and/or reconnect the device; change the entertainment source and change back again; allow the vehicle to enter sleep mode.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Message "No supported audio files found" is displayed when a playlist is selected:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If playlists and audio files are stored in different folders, absolute paths must be used, e.g., /dir1/dir2/track.mp3.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Interference is heard instead of an audio track after a vehicle start with a USB stick connected:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Select a new track manually, or skip forward or back. <br><br><br><br></div>
