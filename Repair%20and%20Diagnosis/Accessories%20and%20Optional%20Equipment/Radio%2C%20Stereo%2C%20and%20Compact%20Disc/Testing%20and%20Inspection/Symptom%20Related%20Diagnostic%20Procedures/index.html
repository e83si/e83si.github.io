<h1>Symptom Related Diagnostic Procedures</h1> <br><br><b>Symptom List In The Case Of Complaints Regarding The Audio System</b><br><br>This symptom list contains radio complaints which are not caused by device malfunctions. Replacing the radio will not eliminate the problem.<br><br><b>Reception</b><br><br><b>Poor reception with radio BMW Business CD RDS (world device CD 43)</b><br>Cause: Incorrect reception area set.<br><br>Radios concerned: Business CD RADS (world set CD 43)<br><br>Situation: The Business radio CD RADS (world device CD43) is designed for all reception areas in the world. If the right reception area is not set in the radio menu "AREA", the result can be poor reception.<br><br>Action: Setting the reception area<br><br>Procedure: Initial commissioning of the radio (replacement device, new device)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fit replacement radio in vehicle and switch on radio.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The message "NO AREA" appears in the radio display (only during initial operation of the radio)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Now switch to the required region ("Europe", "USA", "Canada", "OC+RDS", "Japan").<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>a.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>On E46 radio and DIN unit with "Station button 1".<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>b.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>On E39 radio with first softkey (Station button 1).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Now switch off radio (AREA is saved).<br><br>Procedure: Changing a reception area that has already been set<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>a.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>On E46 and E39 radios<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Switch on service mode (switch on radio and press "m" button within <b>8 seconds</b>)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Now press the "+ button" as many times as required until "AREA" is displayed in the radio display.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Use "Station button 1" now to select the suitable AREA in the menu and switch off the radio (AREA is stored).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>b.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>On DIN radio<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Same procedure as for E46, E39 radio<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>On the DIN radio, depending on the set reception area, a CODE input might be necessary after the changeover.<br><br><b>Temporary reception cutout</b><br>Cause: Radio searches for better alternative frequency in the reception chain. Here the received station has to be interrupted briefly, which leads to gaps in reception.<br><br>Radios concerned: Reverse and Business<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  RDS may be switched off in critical areas. In the case of the "Professional" radio this search for alternative frequencies is carried out with a second receiver. This is the reason that there is no temporary cutout with this radio.<br><br><b>Temporary reception fall off, lattice fence effect</b><br>Cause: Multipath reception fall off - concept-related on VHF - multipath cancellation effect due to wave overlay.<br><br>Radios concerned: Reverse or if no antenna diversity is fitted.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  Can be remedied using antenna diversity (only in conjunction with Business and Professional)<br><br><b>Interference noise or crackle on classical music stations</b><br>Cause: Classical music stations often broadcast with low modulation in order to avoid distortion. As a result, interference is distinctly more discernible.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  No corrective measures possible as the fault is caused by the broadcasting station.<br><br><b>RDS</b><br><br><b>The radio does not set better alternative frequencies on the stations stored under the station buttons.</b><br>Cause: Frequencies have been stored before the station name appears in the display or the station has no alternative frequencies.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  When storing the station, wait until the station name appears in the display.<br><br><b>Radio does not set an alternative, better frequency. Only the frequency appears in the display.</b><br>Cause: RDS is switched off.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  By pressing the RDS button, the station name appears in the display and a search is conducted automatically for the best alternative frequency.<br><br>In certain areas no alternative frequencies are found although they can be set with a manual search.<br><br>Cause: In areas that have stations with permanent regionalization, alternative frequencies cannot be found when regional mode is switched on (REG=ON) if they have another regional identifier.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  REG by pressing the RDS button for a longer period (display: REG=OFF) or switch off the REG button.<br><br><b>Receiver jumps of its own accord to another station (or several other stations)</b><br>Cause: The regional station function is switched off in the radio and the station being listened to broadcasts regional programs.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  REG by pressing the RDS button for a longer period (display: REG=OFF) or switch on the REG button.<br><br><b>Traffic information</b><br><br><b>Radio increases the volume of its own accord or following traffic information it no longer reverts to normal volume.</b><br>Cause: The station has forgotten to reset the traffic information identifier (TA) (common occurrence with private stations).<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  The old status can be restored by switching off the traffic information function (press TP).<br><br>The volume of traffic information increases several seconds before the actual message is received.<br><br>Cause: The station often broadcasts the traffic information identifier (TA) too early (a common practice in order to broadcast the time for traffic information memory).<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  No remedy; caused by the station.<br><br><b>Traffic information volume too loud</b><br>Cause: The traffic information volume can be varied during the announcement. The set volume is stored automatically.<br><br>Radios concerned: Business and Professional.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  During traffic report, set volume lower.<br><br><b>Minimum setting of traffic information volume too loud or too quiet.</b><br>Cause: Basic traffic information volume set too loud or too quiet.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  Adapt basic volume as part of diagnosis procedure or in service mode.<br><br><b>Cassette / CD operation</b><br><br><b>Cassette playback too fast or too slow</b><br>Cause: Cassette has been recorded on a home unit with another speed (too slow or too fast)<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  Check playback using other cassettes.<br><br><b>During the music track search, the cassette does not stop between the tracks.</b><br>Cause: The breaks between the tracks are too short.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  For the music track search, there must be breaks between the tracks of at least <b>4 seconds</b>.<br><br><b>Cassette / CD operation is interrupted by the radio; unable to return to the cassette / CD operating condition.</b><br>Cause: The TP function is on and the station inadvertently broadcasts the traffic information identifier (TA). This interrupts the cassette / CD operation.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  The old status can be restored by switching off the traffic information function (press TP).<br><br><b>Volume / speakers</b><br><br><b>Speed-dependent volume increase is too weak / too strong</b><br>Cause: Set speed dependent volume characteristic curve is not adapted to the vehicle.<br><br>Radios concerned: All radios except of the Top HiFi System is fitted.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  Change the Speed Dependent Volume (GAL) control setting in the DIS under service functions. GAL1 corresponds to the smallest volume increase, GAL4 or GAL6 are the greatest rises.<br><br><b>Speed-dependent volume is not increased</b><br>Cause: Top HiFi System fitted<br><br>Radios concerned: All E38 and E39 radios with Top HiFi System.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  In conjunction with the Top HiFi System, only one characteristic curve is permanently stored in the Top HiFi amplifier. The different GAL stages in the radio are not in operation.<br><br><b>Volume between two stations or between radio station and cassette or CD differs greatly on switching over.</b><br>Cause: Radio stations can broadcast at different modulation levels. The cassette or CD might have been recorded at a different volume.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  Check playback using other stations, other cassettes or CDs.<br><br><b>Loudspeakers boom, rattle or do not produce the desired sound pattern</b><br>Cause: Loose speaker cables can strike body components or neighboring body components can also vibrate.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  Check lines over the entire length and fix with insulating tape as required. Attention should also be paid to ensuring that no neighboring body components are able to vibrate.<br><br><b>Temporary failure of opposing speaker</b><br>Cause: Abrupt changeovers from stereo to mono give the impression that a loudspeaker fails.<br><br>Radios concerned: All<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  In the event of audible interference in reception, reproduction is switched over from stereo to mono as such interference is perceived to be unpleasant in stereo.<br><br><b>Station storage</b><br><br><b>It is necessary to reprogram the stations when driving through different broadcasting areas.</b><br>Cause: The station with the strongest signal in the relevant area can be selected with the autostore function.<br><br>Radios concerned: Business and Reverse<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  Activate autostore function by pressing and holding the FM button. Selection of station buttons in FMA mode.</div>
