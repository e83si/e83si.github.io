Currently, these vehicles will be arriving at your BMW Center with Bluetooth set to active. No retrofit coding is necessary in order to use this feature.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Voice activation functions <br><br>Voice input dialing with M-ASK, RAD-2 or CHAMP-equipped vehicles <br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Before dialing can take place, a nametag and phone number must be stored in the voice input phonebook. This phonebook is separate from the phonebook stored in the handset. Up to 50 voice input entries may be stored.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>With the handset connected, press the voice input button on the steering wheel. Say "Save Name"; the dialog for storing a name is called up. Hint: For easy access to the "Communication" menu, one of the programmable MFL buttons on E60 vehicles may be set to "Telephone List". Refer to "Telephone List". Refer to [NEW] the vehicle owner's manual on how to set the programmable buttons.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Say the name and repeat the entry when prompted. The duration of the name in the phonebook must not exceed approximately 2 seconds.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Say the phone number upon request. The system will repeat the phone number back to you. If it is correct, save the phone number by saying "Save".<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>After the name and number are saved, the number can be dialed by saying "Dial name". The system dialog for selecting an entry is opened.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Say the name on request. Confirm the prompt with "Yes".<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Pressing the phone icon button on the steering wheel will end the call.<br><br>Voice input dialing with CCC-equipped vehicles<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>With the handset connected and the CID displaying the "Communication" menu, press the voice input button on the steering wheel. Say "Dial Name". The phonebook used for voice input dialing is the same phonebook that is stored in the handset.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The system states, "Please say the name from the list".<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Select and say one of the nametags from the telephone address book displayed on the CID.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The system says, "Would you like to be connected to (name tag)".<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Respond with "Yes".<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>System says "Dialing".<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Be sure to wait until the system tone is heard before speaking or the system may not recognize your response.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For E46 and E83 vehicles up to 3/05 production and E85 and E53 vehicles up to 4/05 production, voice activation functions are not part of the TCU. A separate SES module can be installed. Refer to the EPC.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/69713478.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>E46, E83, E85 and E53 vehicles produced between 3/2004 and 8/2004 are equipped with a TCU that does not support Bluetooth. On these vehicles, the TCU can be replaced at the customer's expense with a 2005 MY TCU. Cradles may not be added to these vehicles because of wiring incompatibility.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Please disregard the Owner's Manual insert, shown to the left, indicating Bluetooth functionality. The hardware in these vehicles will not work correctly.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For E60, E63 and E64 vehicles produced from 3/04 to 8/04, Bluetooth functionality can be added by updating the vehicle software using CIP 13.2 or higher. After this is performed, a "Retrofit" of "Tel Bluetooth" needs to be performed. Follow the procedure as described in this Service Information for "Activating Bluetooth" and "Pairing the Handset". Vehicles prior to 3/04 would need to have the TCU replaced with the 2005 MY TCU at the customer's expense, and the vehicle updated to CIP 13.2 or higher. Phone docking cradles may not be added to these vehicles because of wiring incompatibility. Note: This software update and retrofit is not covered under warranty and is at the customer's expense.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Please refer to CenterNet for information on approved Bluetooth handsets.
