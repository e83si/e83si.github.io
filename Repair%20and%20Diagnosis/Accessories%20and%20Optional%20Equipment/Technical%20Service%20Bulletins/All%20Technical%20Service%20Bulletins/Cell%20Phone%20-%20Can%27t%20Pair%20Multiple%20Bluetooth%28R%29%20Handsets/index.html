BMW Assist w/Bluetooth technology, BTUM, ULF). On vehicles equipped with BMW Assist with Bluetooth wireless technology, to confirm whether or not the phone is compatible, visit www.bmwusa.com/bluetooth for a list of handsets that have passed BMW testing for compatibility. Note the following disclaimer on this web site:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>"This list is provided for reference only. The mobile phones listed here have passed compatibility tests as of the date of testing and meet or exceed minimum standards established by BMW. The list is not a warranty for phone performance or functionality. BMW makes no guarantees or warranties as to the performance of each phone while connected to your BMW via Bluetooth Wireless Technology. Furthermore, software releases by BMW, the phone supplier or the wireless carrier dated after testing might alter compatibly results. While many phones are offered with Bluetooth Wireless Technology, not all phones support the necessary profiles to work with your BMW. BMW does not guarantee availability or functionality with all wireless carriers. Functions such as synchronizing the address book and transferring a call into or out of the vehicle may function differently from phone to phone".<br><br>WARRANTY INFORMATION<br><br>Information Only<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/12806369.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer</div>
