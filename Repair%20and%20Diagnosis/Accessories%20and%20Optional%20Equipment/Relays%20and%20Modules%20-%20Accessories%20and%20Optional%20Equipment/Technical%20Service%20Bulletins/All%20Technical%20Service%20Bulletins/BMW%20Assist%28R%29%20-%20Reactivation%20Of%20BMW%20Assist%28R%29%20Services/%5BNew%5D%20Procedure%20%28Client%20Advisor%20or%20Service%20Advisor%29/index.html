Check the vehicle's eligibility status in the DCSnet service history. Document the following information:<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>"Assist Safety Plan expires" date<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>TCU ESN/TCU IMEI status:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>"INACTIVE" or "ACTIVE"<br><br>2. Identify which TCU type is installed in the vehicle by referring to the model section in this bulletin.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>CDMA: proceed to step 3.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>GSM: proceed to step 10.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>INACTIVE: If the customer previously declined or did not renew the BMW Assist services, or if a subscriber agreement was never processed or received, BMW NA deactivates the wireless carrier and Response Center services.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>ACTIVE: The TCU is still activated on the wireless carrier network. The "Assist Safety Plan expires" must be beyond today's date, and the TCU must be active BMW Assist services to work.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The complete reactivation process must be followed for the services to work.<br><br>3. On CDMA TCUs, verify the work that needs to be performed, using the chart below.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/63278407.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><b>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Important information on vehicles equipped with a CDMA TCU from 9/05 production, or if the TCU was replaced on a pre-9/05 production vehicle with newer hardware:</b><br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To comply with wireless service provider restrictions, when a BMW Assist account expires, BMW of North America, LLC must prevent the Network Access Device (NAD) from registering on the wireless network. If a BMW Assist account has expired and the vehicle was produced after 9/05 production, BMW may send the Power Off Command (POC) to the TCU. This means that the NAD will not turn on or register on the network.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When a TCU receives the POC, the BMW workshop tools will not be able to communicate with the NAD. When the DIS/GT1 is unable to communicate with the NAD, the tester will NOT display any information when trying to read the ESN, MIN or MDN. For vehicles which have received the POC, an alternate test module must be used to turn the NAD back on.<br><br>4. Using the above time estimates, identify the scope of work that needs to be performed. Provide the customer with an estimate to reactivate BMW Assist services.<br><br>5. If the customer wishes to reactivate BMW Assist services, he or she must complete a valid, active subscriber agreement with the BMW Assist Response Center through the enrollment application on DCSnet, located at Sales | BMW Assist | Electronic Subscriber Agreement.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Incentives for renewing BMW Assist services: The BMW Assist incentive for selling term extensions is $20 per year of renewed service.
