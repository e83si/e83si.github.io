<h1>Voice Output</h1> <br><br><b>Navigation System With On-board Monitor</b><br><br><b>Function</b><br>The receiver of the GPS satellite navigation system supplies the navigation computer with the current vehicle position in degrees latitude and longitude.<br><br>A CD with map data is loaded in the CD drive of the navigation computer. The navigation computer combines the vehicle position calculated by the GPS with this map data.<br><br>The current position is shown on the on-board monitor under "Location display".<br><br>The driver can enter a destination. The navigation computer calculates a route from the current location to this destination based on selectable criteria (main trunk roads, shortest distance, etc.). The calculated route is shown in the route display.<br><br>With the aid of arrow indicators and distance data on the on-board monitor and a voice output function, the navigation computer indicates how and where to get into the correct lane or turn off while the vehicle is moving.<br><br>The navigation computer calculates the distance covered from the signals from an ABS/ASC/DSC wheel speed sensor.<br><br>An inertia sensor, known as the "GYRO", informs the navigation computer about rotary movements of the vehicle (e.g. when turning off etc.). This gyro sensor is fitted in the casing of the navigation computer.<br><br>An alternative route is recalculated automatically if the driver does not follow the route instructions.<br><br><b>Components</b><br><br><b>Navigation computer incl. CD drive and gyro sensor</b><br>A CD drive is integrated in the navigation computer. The navigation CD is loaded in this drive.<br><br>The navigation computer also features a fan. If the cooling capacity of the fan is not sufficient, the navigation computer is switched off due to overheating and this status is indicated on the on-board monitor.<br><br>The gyro sensor is an inertia sensor which records the forces which occur during a change in direction and transfers this data to the navigation computer in the form of a voltage change. This gyro sensor is fitted in the casing of the navigation computer.<br><br><b>GPS</b><br>The Global Positioning System is a system which was originally developed for military use, in which approx. 20 satellites in earth orbit send position-related signals. These signals are evaluated by a computer specially developed for this purpose and converted into a position. The accuracy of the system varies, however, it is at least within <b>20 m</b>.<br><br>GPS reception is only possible when unobstructed view of the sky is ensured.<br><br>GPS, in conjunction with the BMW navigation system, consists of an antenna and a receiver which evaluates the satellite data received via the antenna and transfers the calculated vehicle position to the navigation computer.<br><br><b>Wheel-speed sensors</b><br>The navigation computer uses the signals from the ABS/ASC/DSC wheel speed sensor to calculate the distance covered.<br><br><b>Navigation CD</b><br>The data the navigation computer requires for route planning is stored on the navigation CD. It is advisable to use the latest updated version in order to take account of any changes in the road system.<br><br>The navigation system can only be selected if a navigation CD has been inserted in the drive.<br><br><b>AF lines</b><br>The sound signals are transferred via 2 AF lines either to the video module or - if no video module is installed (refer to explanation of system setup at the end of this description) - directly to the radio.<br><br><b>RGB lines</b><br>The picture signals are fed across RGB lines either to the video module or - if no video module is fitted - directly to the LC screen (E46, E38, E39, E52, E53 and MINI) or directly to the Central Information Display (E85 and E83).<br><br>It should be noted that different pins are assigned if the picture signals are transmitted directly to the LC screen or Central Information Display or first to the video module.<br><br>The user interface, i.e. the menus on the on-board monitor, is set up by the navigation computer.<br><br><b>The navigation system in the workshop</b><br><br><b>Loading the operating software</b><br>A new version of the operating software offered by BMW should be loaded as follows (refer also to instructions on the CD):<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Switch on terminal R and wait until the navigation system is ready for operation. Ensure there is a stable voltage supply.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the navigation CD from navigation computer.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Insert software CD in navigation computer.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A symbol appears on the on-board monitor after several seconds; the symbol is "filled in" with colors in clockwise direction. When loading has been completed, the following message appears: "The software has been successfully loaded."<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Once the loading procedure is completed, first remove the software CD and then confirm the end of the loading procedure by pressing the rotary push button on the on-board monitor.<br><br>Do not change the terminal setting during the loading procedure! Ensure adequate voltage in the vehicle electrical system.<br><br><b>Coding of navigation computer</b><br>The operating software must be loaded first prior to encoding the navigation computer<br><br><b>BMW Assist</b><br><br><b>Initialization may also be necessary on vehicles with BMW Assist</b><br>After the navigation computer has been replaced, a test drive lasting approx. <b>15 minutes</b> is necessary, during which GPS reception must be ensured.<br><br><b>Navigation computer variants</b><br><br><b>Navigation computer MK2</b><br>In the navigation computer MK2, the GPS receiver is installed in a separate housing.<br><br><b>Navigation computer MK3 and MK4</b><br>In the case of navigation computers MK3 and MK4, the GPS receiver is integrated in the navigation computer.</div>
