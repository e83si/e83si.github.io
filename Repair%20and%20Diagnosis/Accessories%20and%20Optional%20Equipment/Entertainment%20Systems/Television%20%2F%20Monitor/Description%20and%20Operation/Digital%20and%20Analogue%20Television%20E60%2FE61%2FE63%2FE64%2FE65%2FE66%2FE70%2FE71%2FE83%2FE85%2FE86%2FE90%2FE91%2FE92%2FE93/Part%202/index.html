This list is also alphanumerically ordered: e.g. CH3, CH7, CH12, ... for Channel 3, Channel 7, Channel 12.<br><b>Television in front:</b> The list of stations is updated manually by selecting "Autostore".<br><b>Front and rear seat television:</b> The list of stations is updated automatically. <br>The list of stations is also updated if another entertainment module is selected (e.g. if you change to the radio or DVD changer). When the television is called up again the current list of stations is offered automatically.<br><br> <br><br><b>Aerial diversity</b><br>The aerial diversity function, which is integrated in the video module ensures that the stationary vehicle always has the best possible reception. The aerial diversity uses certain criteria to select the TV aerial that offers the best reception.<br>2 TV aerials are fitted for TV reception in the front (TV 1, TV 2). <br>3 TV aerials are fitted for TV reception in the front and rear.<br>To ensure optimum reception, these 3 TV aerials work as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2 TV aerials (TV 1, TV 2) receive the desired TV channel.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1 TV aerial (TV 3) searches in the background for other transmission frequencies for this television station.<br>The required television station is received on the transmission frequencies with the highest signal strength.<br><br>Aerial diversity works as follows:<br>If more than one station have the same name when analogue TV is in use, then there are alternative frequencies. e.g. "Television station 1" is being received on 3 different analogue frequencies. In this case the television station is displayed just once. <br>Aerial diversity automatically selects the best frequency. "Television station 1" is shown in the display.<br>If, however, a television station is transmitting "Television station 1" analogue on several frequencies and "1st digital" digitally on another frequency, then the display shows the following:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Aerial diversity combines all frequencies for analogue television. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The best frequency is selected and displayed. e.g.: "Television station 1".<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>However, aerial diversity is <b>not</b> able to combine the following TV stations: Analogue reception for "Television station 1" and digital reception for the "1st digital". <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This is because: The video module cannot assign the two different notations and meanings to one another. <br>This means "Television station 1" appears twice in the list of stations: Once analogue as "Television station 1" and once digitally as the "1st digital".<br><br> <br><br><b>Video switch</b><br>The video module switchers between the various video sources, e.g. between television and video.<br>This function is called "video switch".<br><br><b>Operation</b><br>The following operations are described:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Adjusting screen settings<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Selecting television stations<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Updating list of stations<br><br><b>Note: Please comply with instructions in Owner's Handbook.</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Detailed instructions for the television can be found in the vehicle's Owner's Handbook.<br><br> <br><br><b>Adjusting screen settings</b><br>Users can adjust the screen settings for color, contrast and brightness: Call up the corresponding menu (with the controller on the CD or CID). <br>The controller controls the monitor settings.<br><br>Depending on the equipment specification, the screen setting is processed in the following control units:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicles with television in the front: <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E60, E61, E63, E64, E70, E71, E90, E91, E92, E93: Car Communication Computer (CCC)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E65, E66, R83, E85, E86: <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For vehicles <b>with </b><a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a>, the screen setting is processed in the control unit for the navigation system (NAV).<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>On vehicles <b>without</b> <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a>, the video module processes the monitor settings.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicles with rear display <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E65, E66: The video module processes the monitor settings for the rear display.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E70, E71: The RSE control unit processes the monitor settings for the rear display.<br><br> <br><br><b>Selecting television stations</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select country (on Control Display or Central Information Display)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When a country is selected, the video module will set the correct television standard.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select the required television station from the list of stations.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The video module administers a list of stations with all receivable television stations.
