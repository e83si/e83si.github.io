It is absolutely vital to disconnect the contacts in succession as there is a risk of them being mixed up! Cut through one cable after the other at an appropriate position, do not under any circumstances cut through both cables at the same time. Insulate cables remaining in wiring harness with insulating tape. Now disconnect plug connection on airbag control unit. Unpin contacts. Cut through one cable after the other at an appropriate position and insulate with insulating tape, do not under any circumstances cut through both cables at the same time. Pin contacts of repair cable for airbag control unit in control unit plug, assignment of repair cables is relevant. Lay repair cable in car parallel to existing airbag lead. Now pin in contacts for airbag control unit or contacts of adapter plug, assignment of repair cables is relevant. Cut off excess length of repair cable in proximity (visible area) of airbag module or of adapter plug. Twist open cables. With the connectors and shrink-fit hoses in the Electronic Parts Catalog (EPC), reconnect the cables with the same cable colors. Twist cables again, open length (twist) must not exceed 40 mm. Secure interface (shrink-fit hoses) with insulating tape to prevent cables from twisting open.<br>Instructions for cutting off, insulating, crimping cables, installing and removing contacts:<br>Cutting off and insulating cables <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Service%2520and%2520Repair/61%252013%2520...%2520Cutting%2520to%2520Length%2520and%2520Stripping%2520Insulation%2520From%2520Cables/index.html">61 13 ...
