This is necessary because pyrotechnical objects can cause injury if improperly activated (e.g. scrapping with flame cutters). <br>With above-mentioned vehicles which are scheduled for scrapping, it is always essential prior to draining and further stripping work to ensure that <b>all</b> the gas generators <b>in the vehicle</b> are fired. The fired gas generators can then be scrapped together with the vehicle.<br><b>Triggering failure</b><br>If correct triggering is not possible, the relevant components must (while observing the safety regulations for handling airbag system components) be removed and disposed of by special disposal companies!<br>If a triggering operation has failed:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Disconnect the triggering device from the battery and<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>only approach the vehicle after a few minutes have elapsed<br><b>The components of an airbag system must always be disposed of. Such components must not be sold on as used parts.</b><br><b>Triggering</b><br>Triggering of the gas generators may only be carried out by expert personnel and under the supervision of a responsible person. Other standard accident prevention regulations (safety goggles, ear defenders etc.) must also be observed. <br>The gas generators must be fired from the outside in the vehicle scheduled for scrapping with the doors closed but with the tailgate, door windows and sunroof open. To fire the gas generators, use the BMW-developed triggering device with the corresponding cables.<br><br><b>Warning!</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Once gas generators have been fired, observe a ventilation period of 10 minutes with the doors opened. Only then is it permitted to continue work inside the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Wear protective goggles and protective gloves when handling a fired gas generator!<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The burning of solid fuel will heat up airbag unit - danger of burning hands!<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Wash skin with water after contact with fired gas generators!<br><br><b>1.
