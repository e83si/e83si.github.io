This is necessary because pyrotechnical objects can cause injury if improperly activated (e.g. scrapping with flame cutters). <br>With vehicles which are scheduled for scrapping, it is always essential prior to draining and further stripping work to ensure that all the gas generators <b>in the vehicle</b> are fired. The fired gas generators can then be scrapped together with the vehicle.<br><b>Gas generators that have not fired constitute a hazard (also to the environment)!</b><br><b>Firing failure:</b><br>If correct firing is not possible, the relevant components must be removed and disposed of by special waste disposal companies!<br>Comply with safety regulations <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Restraints%2520and%2520Safety%2520Systems/Air%2520Bag%2520Systems/Service%2520Precautions/Technician%2520Safety%2520Information/Safety%2520Regulations%2520for%2520Handling%2520Components%2520with%2520Gas%2520Generators/index.html">[1]</a><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Restraints%20and%20Safety%20Systems/Air%20Bag%20Systems/Service%20Precautions/Technician%20Safety%20Information/">[2]</a><a>Safety Regulations for Handling Components with Gas Generators</a> <b>for handling airbag system components</b>.<br>If a firing operation has failed:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Disconnect the firing device from the battery and<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Only approach the vehicle after a few minutes have elapsed<br><b>The components of an airbag system must always be disposed of.
