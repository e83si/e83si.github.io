This is necessary because pyrotechnical objects can result in injury if improperly activated (e.g. when being scrapped with a cutting burner).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>In the above-mentioned vehicles that are destined for scrapping, you must always ensure that all the gas generators; in the vehicle have been fired before draining and subsequent disassembly operations. The fired gas generators can then be scrapped together with the vehicle.<br><br><b>Firing failure</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If proper firing is not possible, the relevant components must be removed and disposed of by special waste-disposal companies in compliance with the safety regulations for handling components of the airbag system!<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If firing has malfunctioned, disconnect the firing device from the battery and wait several minutes before approaching the vehicle!<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Components of an airbag system must always be disposed of. Airbag-system components must never be sold on as used parts.<br><br><b>Firing</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Firing may only be carried out by specially trained personnel and under the supervision of a responsible person. Also observe the otherwise usual accident prevention regulations (protective goggles, hearing protection etc.).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Gas generators must be fired from outside the vehicle to be scrapped with the doors closed, however with the trunk lid, side windows and sunroof open. Use the firing device developed by BMW with the corresponding cables.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Caution!</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Once gas generators have fired, you must observe a ventilation period of 10 minutes with the doors open before continuing work!<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Wear protective goggles and protective gloves when handling a fired gas generator!<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The burning of solid fuel will heat up the airbag unit-danger of burns!<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Wash skin with water after contact with fired gas generators!<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Driver's airbag up to model year 94<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.1<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Remove the lower section of the steering column paneling and separate the plug connection (orange) from the airbag unit.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.2<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Connect the firing device 62 1 270 to the connector; if necessary, in conjunction with cable 62 1 280 or 621 233.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.3<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Connect firing device to a 12 V battery (distance from vehicle: <b>10 m</b>).<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.4<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Observe distance to car according to firing cable length-location always behind car (also relates to other persons).<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.5<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Press switch on firing device-airbag fires.
