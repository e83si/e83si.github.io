<h1>Crash-Active Head Restraint (As of 09/07)</h1> <br><br><br><br><b>Crash-active head restraint</b><br>On triggering, the crash-active head restraint locks the distance between the head restraint and head in order to reduce the load on the cervical vertebrae during a rear-end collision. <br>(Reason: The distance between the head and head restraint can increase as the result of the individual setting options of the seat.)<br><br><br><b>Brief description of components</b><br>The following components are described:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Crash-active head restraint<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>ACSM or MRS: Crash safety module or multiple restraint system <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(ACSM stands for �Advanced Crash Safety Module�, referred to as the "crash safety module".)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Airbag control lamp<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Crash-active head restraint<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The crash-active head restraint is available for the driver's and passenger's seat. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The crash-active head restraint can be recognized in that it is split into two parts. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There are 2 versions of the crash-active head restraint:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Crash-active head restraint for the comfort seat<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The depth adjustment of the head restraint can be set via the backrest-head adjustment.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Crash-active head restraint for all seats except comfort seat<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The button for setting the head restraint (depth adjustment) is installed in the side surface of the front section of the head restraint. It enables the position of the front section of the head restraint to be varied in 3 positions by up to 30 millimetres depending on what the occupant wants. <br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>For the forward depth adjustment, the front section of the head restraint only needs to be pulled (2 lock positions). For the backward depth adjustment, press the button in the front section of the head restraint. This releases the catch.The front section of the head restraint can be pressed backwards.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In the event of a rear-end collision, the front section of the head restraint is moved forwards instantly by spring force by up to 60 millimetres and upwards by up to 40 millimetres (depending on the current depth adjustment). This reduces the distance to the head.<br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/885825489.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><br><br>Index <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Explanation<br>A <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Crash-active head restraint (not triggered)<br>B <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Crash-active head restraint (triggered)<br>1 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Front section of the head restraint<br>2 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Head restraint support<br>3 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Button for setting the head restraint (depth adjustment)<br>4 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  On triggering, max. total path forwards: 60 millimetres<br>5 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  On triggering, max. total path upwards: 40 millimetres<br>6 <span class='indent-right-align'>&#09;</span>  Mechanical system for setting the head restraint as well as for motion of the head restraint in a triggering sequence<br> <br><br>If the crash safety module or MRS control module sends a trigger signal, the crash-active head restraint triggers as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The priming cap in the pyrotechnic component ignites the propellant charge. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The pyrotechnic component contains the priming cap and propellant charge (designation in the connection scheme: �Inflator assembly, front left active head restraint� and �Inflator assembly, front right active head restraint�).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The propellant charge drives a pin.

Designation of the pyrotechnic component in the electronic parts catalogue: gas cartridge). <br>Only after replacement of the pyrotechnic component can the springs in the head restraint be tensioned again. This means: After activating the crash-active head restraint, the front section of the head restraint can no longer be locked in place. The front section of the head restraint is always pressed forwards by the spring force.<br><br>After replacing the pyrotechnic component, clear the fault memory.<br><br> <br><br>No liability can be accepted for printing or other faults.
