The passenger airbag is integrated into the instrument panel above the glove compartment. The driver and passenger airbags each have a dual-stage gas generator. The airbags are triggered at different levels depending on the severity of the accident.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Side airbags</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The side airbags reduce the risk of injury to the occupants in the event of a side collision.

The seat belt always has a small degree of play to guarantee the occupants an adequate degree of comfort. The play of a fastened seat belt is know as slack. The prevent the negative effects of this slack, the seat belt buckle is pulled down several centimeters by gas generators in the event of an accident. This pulls the seat belt tight.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Safety battery terminal</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Depending on the severity of the accident, the safety battery terminal disconnects the starter motor and the alternator from the power circuit.

The airbag warning lamp is located in the instrument cluster and is controlled by the MRS control unit (via the K bus).<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the ignition is switched on, the MRS performs a self test. While this is being run, the airbag warning lamp lights up (approximately 3 to 5 seconds). When the system is ready, the airbag warning lamp goes out.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If, during the self test or while the vehicle is in motion, the MRS control unit detects an existing fault or one that has been stored, the airbag warning lamp remains on.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the MRS detects a fault, the operational capability is partially maintained, if possible, subject to the following:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If a fault is detected in an MRS circuit, only the affected circuit is deactivated. The other airbags and belt tensioners remain operational.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If there is a fault in the airbag warning lamp circuit, the lamp does not light up. If there is no other fault, the MRS remains fully operational.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If there is an internal fault in the MRS control unit or in the power supply, the entire system is deactivated.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Deactivation of the passenger airbag and the front right-hand side airbag</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The passenger airbag and the front right-hand side airbag are deactivated by a coding procedure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Warning lamp for passenger-airbag deactivation (US version)</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the warning lamp for passenger-airbag deactivation (passenger airbag off lamp) is lit, both airbags on the passenger side have been deactivated: the passenger airbag and the front right-hand side airbag <br>The passenger airbag off lamp is constantly monitored by the MRS control unit. A fault in the power supply or a defective lamp is stored in the MRS control unit's fault memory. If this occurs, the airbag warning lamp is switched on. <br>The passenger airbag OFF lamp is located in the control panel in the overhead console.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Shutting off the fuel pump</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When an airbag is triggered, the fuel feed is also shut off.<br>Mechanical components in the multiple restraint system (MRS):<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b><a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Restraints%2520and%2520Safety%2520Systems/Seat%2520Belt%2520Systems/Seat%2520Belt/index.html">Seat belts</a></b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The seat belts are the primary restraint system for all occupants.

To minimize this risk, the front seat belts are fitted with belt force limiters as standard. The belt force limiters allow the seat belt to be unrolled in a controlled fashion if the belt force exceeds a critical value. The risk of injury due to the belt force acting on the body is therefore reduced.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Passive knee protection (US version)</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Not every state in the USA has a requirement for <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Restraints%2520and%2520Safety%2520Systems/Seat%2520Belt%2520Systems/Seat%2520Belt/index.html">seat belts</a> to be worn. Therefore, the E83 also has additional plastic impact protection on the driver and passenger sides. In the event of an impact, the passive knee protection provides a flat support for the lower leg, especially if the front passengers are not wearing their seat belts. This causes the forwards movement of the upper body to be controlled towards the relevant airbag (driver or passenger airbag).<br><br><b>System functions</b><br>The following system functions of the multiple restraint system (MRS) are described:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Triggering the multiple restraint system<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Emergency call (EURO version)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Emergency call (US version)<br><br> <br><br><b>Triggering the multiple restraint system</b><br>Extensive testing has allowed the triggering thresholds to be determined for all possible types of accidents.<br>Various triggering thresholds were set for activating the different restraint systems:<br>The multiple restraint system comprises:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Belt tensioners<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Front airbags<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Side airbags<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Head airbags<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Safety battery terminal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Electric fuel pump<br>The following examples illustrate how the various restraint systems are triggered:<br><br> <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Head-on collision</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The belt tensioners, the front airbags and the safety battery terminal are triggered if the head-on collision is so severe that the triggering threshold of the MRS control unit is exceeded. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The belt tensioners have a lower triggering threshold than the front airbags. The belt tensioners are therefore triggered earlier. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the seat-belt-lock switch is faulty, the triggering threshold for the front airbag on this side is lowered. Even though there is a fault message, the MRS control unit will try to trigger the belt tensioners. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the seat-occupancy detector is faulty, the control unit assumes that the passenger seat is occupied. The restraint systems are activated. <br>The electric fuel pump is switched off.
