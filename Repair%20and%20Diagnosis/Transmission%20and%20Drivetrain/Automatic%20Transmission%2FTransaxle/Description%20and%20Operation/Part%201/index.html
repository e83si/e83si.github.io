Depending on the importance of the associated message, a single or double gong with varying volume and tone will sound. The instrument cluster controls these warnings by means of the K-CAN.

Within the limitations of the laws of physics, DSC compensates for driving conditions such as over/understeering. As part of this process, dynamic driving signals (e.g. wheel rotation speed, lateral acceleration) are sent to the DSC <a>control unit</a>. DSC transmits the processed signals regarding cornering, acceleration and winter detection to the EGS control unit.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Accelerator pedal module</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The signal from the accelerator pedal module is needed for the adaptive transmission control.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>JBE: Junction box electronics</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E70, E81, E87, E90, E91, E92, E93<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The JBE is the data interface (= gateway) between the K-CAN and the PT-CAN.

(K-CAN = body CAN; PT-CAN = powertrain CAN; F-CAN = chassis CAN.)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The junction box consists of the JBE and the power distributor. <br>The power distributor provides power, amongst other things, for the gate pattern diagram and the EGS <a>control unit</a>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>KGM: Body gateway module</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E60, E61, E63, E64 from 09/05<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>From 09/05, the vehicle electrical system has been modified. The body gateway module (KGM) supersedes the SGM.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The KGM is the data interface (= gateway) between the K-CAN and the PT-CAN. (K-CAN = body CAN; PT-CAN = powertrain CAN.) The diagnosis wire is connected to the KGM.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>SGM: Safety and gateway module</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E60, E61, E63, E64 up to 09/05 <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>> E65, E66 <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The SGM is the data interface (= gateway) between the K-CAN, <b>byteflight</b> and the PT-CAN.

The EGS <a>control unit</a> normally selects the economical XE map (= basic map). In case of particular demands (e.g. load requirements), the system will change to the performance-orientated E map. If the input signals change in favor of a more gentle driving style, the system will change back to the more economical XE map.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Sport program in selector lever position "M/S"<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The sport program effects dynamic, sporty shift characteristics. In the sport program, there is the basic S map (sport) and the performance-orientated XS map (extreme sport). If an extremely dynamic driving style is called for, the system will change from the S map to the performance-orientated XS map.<br>The adaptive transmission control takes the following demands into account: <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Adaptation to driver type<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Driving uphill or trailer towing<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Driving downhill<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Braking deceleration and automatic upshift<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Winter program<br><br> <br><br><b>Adaptation to driver type</b><br>The adaptation to different driver types is done using the following values: <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Kick-fast<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the accelerator pedal is depressed rapidly, the shift program is changed accordingly. This is achieved by the detected accelerator-pedal value being compared with threshold values in the EGS <a>control unit</a>. The result of this comparison is the proposal of one of the two possible programs (XE or E in comfort program, S or XS in sport program).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cornering detection<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cornering detection reacts to the vehicle's lateral acceleration with an indirect adaptation to the driver type. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lateral acceleration is considered an indirect statement of the preferred driving dynamics and does not cause an immediate gearshift response (shifts when cornering could adversely affect driving stability).<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lateral acceleration is calculated from the signals from the wheel-speed sensors, from the yaw rate and road speed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Brake evaluation<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The braking action is evaluated in a similar way to "kick-fast". <br>The braking deceleration is measured and compared with threshold values in the EGS <a>control unit</a>. The result of this comparison is the proposal of one of the two possible programs (XE or E in comfort program, S or XS in sport program).<br>The driver-type adaptation is restarted each time the vehicle pulls away from a standstill.<br><br> <br><br><b>Driving uphill or trailer towing</b><br>These functions are based on a comparison of actual car acceleration with a nominal value. From the current engine operating situation, the acceleration with normal load on a level surface is calculated. If the actual acceleration is significantly below the theoretical value, the "Driving uphill or trailer towing" function is activated.<br>The design of the corresponding shift characteristics allows a high-speed driving style. Undesirable upshifts and frequent up/downshifts are eliminated or greatly reduced.<br><br> <br> <br><br><br></div>
