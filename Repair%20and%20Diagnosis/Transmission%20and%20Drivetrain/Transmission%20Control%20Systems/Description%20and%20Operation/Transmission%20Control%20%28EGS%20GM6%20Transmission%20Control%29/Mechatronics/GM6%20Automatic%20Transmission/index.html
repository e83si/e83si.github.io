<h1>GM6 Automatic Transmission</h1> <br><br><br><b>GM6 automatic transmission</b><br>The GM6 automatic transmission is a fully automatic 6-speed automatic transmission for back-wheel / all-wheel drive with electronic control.<br><br><br><b>Brief description of components</b><br>The GM6 automatic transmission consists essentially of the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Torque converter<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Converter housing<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Integrated oil pump<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2 planetary gear sets<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>5 multi-plate clutches<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Mechatronics module <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The mechatronics module is a combination of a hydraulic unit (hydraulic selector unit) and an electronic module. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The hydraulic unit is the hydraulic part of the transmission control. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The electronic module contains the EGS control module, the sensors as well as the electrical connections inside the transmission.<br><br><br><b>System functions</b><br>The following system functions are described:<br><br><b>Emergency program</b><br>The emergency program is activated on failure of the transmission control or on detection of faults that lead to critical driving states. In the emergency program, the vehicle can still be driven with certain restrictions.<br><br>There are two different types of emergency program:<br><br>Hydraulic emergency program<br><br>In the event of failure of an electrical component, the transmission can switch into the hydraulic emergency program. In this case, all the solenoid valves are switched off and the transmission shifts, if the 1st, 2nd or 3rd gear is engaged, permanently into 3rd gear. <br>If the 4th, 5th or 6th gear is engaged in the event of failure of the electrical equipment, the transmission shifts permanently into 5th gear. <br>When the transmission is operating in the emergency program, 5th gear is engaged and the ignition is switched of and on again, the transmission shifts to 3rd gear.<br><br><br>Electrical emergency program<br><br>If a gripping clutch does not correctly engage or the releasing clutch does not correctly disengage, the transmission control can switch into the emergency program. The transmission works in the restricted mode. Defective clutches are not used. This means that only a limited number of gears is available.<br><br><br> <br><br>No liability can be accepted for printing or other faults. Subject to changes of a technical nature<br></div>
