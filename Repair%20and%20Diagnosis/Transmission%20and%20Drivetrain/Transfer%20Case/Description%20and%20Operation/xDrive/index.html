The rear axle is always powered. <br>All of the drive torque is applied to the rear axle when the multi-plate clutch is separated.<br><br>> - E53, E83 [system overview ...]<br>> - E70 [system overview ...]<br>xDrive constantly communicates with the DSC. The drive-dynamic input information is computed in the DSC <a>control unit</a>.<br>Important information is:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Accelerator pedal position<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine torque<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive-dynamic state<br>The DSC calculates the necessary locking torque. The locking torque is communicated to xDrive. This allows xDrive to register whether the vehicle is able to follow the driver's commands. xDrive intervenes to counter the threat of any tendency for wheel spin, oversteer or understeer. xDrive regulates drive torque distribution between the two axles to meet driving demands. <br>Only if xDrive cannot maintain the vehicle's course on its own will DSC also intervene. Engine output is reduced and individual wheels are specifically braked.<br>The drive torque is delivered to the axle that has better traction when road conditions change, such as on snow, ice or a loose road surface.<br>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Transfer%20Case/">transfer cases</a> are matched to vehicles as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E53: ATC 500 <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Transfer%20Case/">transfer case</a><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(ATC = Active Torque Control)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E70: ATC 700 <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Transfer%20Case/">transfer case</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>E83: ATC 400 transfer case<br>The transfer cases differ in the following points:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Different number of plates in the multi-plate clutches<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Different clearance between the input and output shafts to the front axle<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Propeller shaft inserted into the front axle differential on the E53, E70, and flange-mounted on the E83<br>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Transfer%20Case/">transfer case</a> is designed to be stronger on the E53, E70 in order to match the higher engine torques.<br><br><b>The advantages:</b> <br>xDrive delivers the following advantages through demand-oriented drive torque distribution:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Outstanding driving stability fully up to the limit range<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Optimal forward momentum<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Excellent traction in all road situations <br>xDrive is standard equipment on the E70, E83 and on the E53 from October 2003 with the new model version.<br><br><b>Brief description of components</b><br>xDrive consists of the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Transfer%20Case/">Transfer case</a> with multi-plate clutch</b> <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The electronically controlled multi-plate clutch is housed in the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Transfer%20Case/">transfer case</a>.

The brakes are applied on all four wheels to reduce road speed to just above walking pace.

This means that the front axle can be smoothly coupled to the drive train. The drive torque at the front axle can be increased or reduced in response to the road situation and conditions.<br><br>The DSC <a>control unit</a> calculates the locking torque for the multi-plate clutch as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pre-activation = driver's command<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Driving dynamic control<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Detection of different tire rolling circumferences<br><br> <br><br><b>Pre-activation</b><br>The pre-activation circuit reflects the driver's wishes.

Driving dynamic control has the task of achieving optimum traction and keeping the car stable or to stabilize it. <br><br>The following evaluation criteria are taken into account by the monitoring system:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wheel speeds<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Yaw rate<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lateral acceleration<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Steering angle<br>The drive torque is distributed as follows in normal driving with all-wheel drive:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>40% to the front axle<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>60% to the rear axle<br>Distribution of the drive torque is oriented upon the torque that can be supported by each axle. For instance, if the car is fully accelerated in 1st gear from a standing start the distribution of the dynamic axle-load creates a higher axle load on the rear axle. Therefore, the rear axle can convey a higher drive torque.<br>Example: The front wheels are on a high-traction surface. The rear wheels are on, e.g. sheet ice (low traction). In this case, almost 100% of the available drive torque would be transmitted to the front axle. The rear axle is under hardly any load any can support only a low drive torque.<br><br>When driving in a curve, the lateral acceleration causes centrifugal force that forces the car to the outside. The car leaves the stable driving condition when the centrifugal force is stronger than the maximum possible wheel lateral guiding forces. "Understeer" is the phrase used when the car presses outwards over the front wheels. Oversteer, on the other hand, is when the rear wheel adhesion becomes lower. The rear of the car presses outwards.<br><br>xDrive minimizes the tendency to understeer or oversteer by optimally distributing the driving power between the rear axle and front axle. <br><br> <br><br> <br><br><b>Detection of different tire rolling circumferences</b><br>If the tire rolling circumferences are not the same the drive train twists due to different rotary speeds (when the multi-plate clutch is closed).<br><br>Differences in rotational speed can occur as a result of the following influences:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When tires of different makes and types are fitted:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The tire rolling circumference may fluctuate by up to 1% due to tires of different makes and types being fitted or the tires are worn very differently.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When an emergency wheel is fitted<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the tires are worn very differently<br>Slip in the multi-plate clutch may compensate for differences in rotary speed when different tire rolling circumferences are detected.<br>Compensation is produced by reducing the locking torque in situations that do not have great driving dynamic control.<br><br> <br><br><b>Emergency operation</b><br>Driving dynamic control and the ADB-X function are not possible in emergency operation. <br>The VTG <a>control unit</a> has an integral regulator for emergency control. The regulator provides redundancy for controlling the multi-plate clutch in the DSC control units.<br>The regulator is used to attempt to maintain all-wheel drive for as long as possible when the DSC <a>control unit</a> malfunctions or important sensor signals drop out. <br>Substitute values are calculated when individual sensor signals drop out. Functions are operated by using the substitute values until it is no longer possible to control the all-wheel drive effectively. This can lead to the complete loss of all-wheel drive.<br><br><b>Notes for service staff</b><br>Service staff should note the following points:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>General information: <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Diagnosis: ---<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Encoding/programming: ---<br><br>Subject to change.</div>
