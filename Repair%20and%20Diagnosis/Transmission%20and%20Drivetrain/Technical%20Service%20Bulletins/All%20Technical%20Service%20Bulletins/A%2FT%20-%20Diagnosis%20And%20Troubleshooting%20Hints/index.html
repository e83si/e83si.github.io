<h1>A/T - Diagnosis And Troubleshooting Hints</h1>SI B 24 23 07<br>Automatic Transmission<br><br>November 2009<br>Technical Service<br><br>This Service Information bulletin supersedes SI B24 23 07 dated February 2008.<br><br>[NEW] designates changes to this revision<br><br>SUBJECT<br>6-Speed Automatic Transmissions Diagnosis and Troubleshooting Hints<br><br>MODEL<br>All with ZF 6HP transmission<br><br>All with GM6 transmission<br><br>SITUATION<br>Diagnosing symptoms involving 6-speed automatic transmissions and determining the root causes of the complaints are the areas where specialized assistance is often needed. Due to the high cost and complexity of the 6-speed automatic transmissions, an Enhanced Technical Support process has been developed to help identify the root causes of customer complaints relating to Automatic Transmissions concerns.<br><br>All diagnostic and troubleshooting steps listed in this Service Bulletin should be performed prior to submitting a PuMA case ("TC Case" or regular technical support "Case").<br><br>A PuMA case may be submitted ONLY after all appropriate diagnostic steps and/or hints listed below were performed and diagnostic results are inconclusive (regular technical support case) or when a component replacement (transmission, Mechatronic, or VB-TECHM) is requested ("TC Case"). Such a PuMA case must include all the necessary information required by B24 23 07.<br><br><b>IMPORTANT</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Both "TC Cases" and regular technical support "Cases" will NOT be processed and will be rejected as "unjustified" if the basic diagnostic troubleshooting procedures and corresponding information required by SI B24 23 07 are not performed and submitted.<br><br>PROCEDURE<br>When diagnosing the 6-speed automatic transmission complaints, the following troubleshooting steps should be performed, and required information needs to be included in a PuMA contact (both "TC Case" or a regular technical support case):<br><br>1.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Customer Concern<br> <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle to reproduce the customer's complaint.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Be as specific as possible when describing the issue at hand, including the exact driving and environmental conditions required to reproduce the complaint. ("Transmission is shifting badly" will create more questions than answers).<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>If the complaint cannot be verified, contact the customer to obtain a specific description of the problem. If possible, test drive with the customer, observing any unusual driving habits (e.g., "Two-footed driver").<br><br>2.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>FASTA Data<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Perform a "Short Test" and transmit the FASTA data prior to programming or troubleshooting. In many instances, the "uncontaminated" FASTA information may be helpful in determining the root cause.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Transmission Fluid Level/Fluid Condition<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Check the fluid level for all transmission concerns, even if there are no obvious signs of external leakage.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Follow the appropriate fluid level checking procedures. The main items to remember are:<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Check the level at fluid temperature between 30� to 50� C.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Engine running at idle.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Transmission in Park.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Vehicle leveled and secured against movements.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>If the fluid does not flow out when the plug is removed, then add the appropriate amount until it trickles out. DO NOT insert your fingers into the filler hole to check where the transmission fluid is!!!<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Make sure that you are checking the fluid level at the correct filler (overflow) plug, since they have different locations. (On the E53 with 6HP26, the overflow plug is in the pan; on other applications, it is located on the side or at the rear of the transmission.)<br><br>4.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Transmission Shift Concerns and Fluid Leaks<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Adjust and/or correct the fluid level, and then clear the EGS adaptation values and test drive.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>If the shift issue is resolved, then address the root cause of the leak.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>If the complaint is unresolved, then submit a PuMA case for further instruction.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>External Damage<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Inspect the transmission oil pan for obvious signs of impact.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Inspect the external shift or emergency release cable adjustment, bracket and lever.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Transmission Fault Codes<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>[NEW] Diagnostic fault codes are an essential tool for troubleshooting. Print and secure the fault codes before clearing. Perform all applicable ISTA (GT1) test plans as prompted by the EGS fault codes stored.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>For the EDS (pressure regulators) and the MV (magnetic valves) fault codes, check the environmental conditions when the faults were set. In general, electronic transmission control units work correctly when the voltage range is between 10V and 15V. If the fault codes environmental conditions indicate voltage below 10V or above 15V, then troubleshoot vehicle's electrical system, e.g., the battery, battery connections, grounds, charging system, the integrity of the vehicle's transmission harness and its connector (X85xx).<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Prioritize the relevance of all driveability-related faults stored in the DME, DSC or EGS control modules. For example, if the vehicle ran out of fuel and the engine stalled, the consecutive misfire and transmission gear monitoring faults (slippage faults) are irrelevant.Various engine driveability complaints ("stumbling, poor running, hesitation") caused by poor fuel quality may also result in transmission shift quality complaints.<br><br>7.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Aftermarket Equipment<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Inspect the vehicle for the presence of any aftermarket equipment (including wheels and tires), or software which may affect vehicle performance or may cause customer concern.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Mention any modifications to the vehicle (e.g., "Conversion to a stretch limo") in the submitted PuMA case.<br><br>8.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Programming Replacement Transmissions and Mechatroniks/VB-TECHMs <br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Print the short and the long EGS ID page before removing the transmission or Mechatronik (VB-TECHM). You may need the part numbers for the programming of the replacement unit. Refer to SI B24 18 07 (Programming of replacement Transmission or Mechatronic) for helpful hints on EGS programming.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>[NEW] On vehicles equipped with the GWS gear shifter, prior to transmission or Mechatronic replacement, perform the "EWS Reset Function" using the ISTA path: "Service Functions/Transmission control/Calibrations/EWS Reset/Test plan".<br><br>9.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Repair History<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Check the repair history to see if there were any recent repairs that could affect the proper operation of the transmission. (If the vehicle returns with a transmission slippage concern after an oil leak repair, chances are that the transmission fluid level is incorrect, causing a new driveability complaint.)<br><br>10.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>SI Bulletins<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Check to see if there are any Service Information Bulletins that apply to your specific complaint. Make sure that both "subject" content and the affected vehicle model match your case.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Follow the SI B instructions exactly. (SI B24 14 07 states that the guibo needs to be removed for the inspection; a visual external inspection will not be sufficient to reveal the loose bushings that we are checking it for.)<br><br>11.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Vehicle VIN Number<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Double check the VIN number before submitting a PuMA case. The incorrect VIN will prevent access to FASTA information. Also, the requested IBAC programming codes will not work with an incorrect VIN.<br><br>12.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Transmission Serial Number/Part Number<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Always provide a transmission serial number and part number from the transmission's ID tag. The transmission serial number is an essential piece of information needed by the Hotline Expert; it is especially useful on repeat complaints after a transmission replacement.<br><br>13.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>PuMA Reporter and Valid Phone Number<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Preferably, the reporter listed in the PuMA case should also be the person who works on the vehicle. If it's not possible, mention your name in the "Work performed" section of the case.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Always provide a direct and a valid phone number so that you can easily be contacted if necessary by the Transmission Expert.<br><br>[NEW] WARRANTY INFORMATION<br>TeileClearing is required for part replacement to be paid by BMW NA via Warranties: Limited New Vehicle Warranty, Certified Pre-Owned Protection Plan, Federal and California Emission Control Warranty, Original Owner Protection Program and Extended Vehicle Protection Programs.<br><br>It is not required to submit a TeileClearing case for an out-of-warranty situation, i.e., BMW Center Administered Customer Assistance Program/Self Authorization (Goodwill). When technical assistance is required to ensure "Fix It Right The First Time", please submit a regular technical support "Case" and do not submit a "TC Case".<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/12806369.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer <br><br></div>
