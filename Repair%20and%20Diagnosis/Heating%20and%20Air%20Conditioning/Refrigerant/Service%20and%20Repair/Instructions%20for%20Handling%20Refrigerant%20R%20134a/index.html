<h1>Instructions for Handling Refrigerant R 134a</h1><br><br><br><b>64 50 ... - Instructions for handling <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Refrigerant/index.html">refrigerant</a> R 134a</b><br><br><b>Warning!</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Although R 134a at normal temperature is non-toxic, non-flammable and not explosive in air in any mixture ratio, it is still essential to follow various safety precautions.<br><br>The filled <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Refrigerant/index.html">refrigerant</a> circuit of the A/C system is subject to gauge pressure. When carrying out repairs on the A/C system, it is absolutely essential to draw off the refrigerant.<br>Do not weld or solder on filled A/C systems or in rooms into which R 134a may have leaked. Exposure to flames or high temperatures (&ge; 50 &deg;C) may give rise to toxic decomposition products (fluorine gas). For this reason, do not smoke either.<br>R 134a must be drawn off, cleaned and returned to the A/C system with a service station following the relevant operating instructions.<br>Avoid all contact with liquid or gaseous R 134a. Wear protective goggles and gloves when working on the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Refrigerant/index.html">refrigerant</a> circuit. R 134a acting on the skin can cause frostbite. Rinse affected body parts thoroughly with cold water. If R 134a gets into your eyes, likewise rinse with plenty of water and, if necessary, remove contact lenses if worn. Then seek immediate medical attention. Likewise seek immediate medical attention if you experience problems after inhaling R 134a fumes.<br>As a gas, R 134a is colorless, odorless and heavier than air. If it gets into the atmosphere, this may result especially in workshop pits in an imperceptible danger of asphyxiation or in cardiac palpitations. Ventilate rooms adequately; if necessary, turn on installed extractor systems.<br>For a properly functioning A/C system, it is essential to have the greatest possible levels of cleanliness when working on the A/C system and the best possible evacuation (at least 30 minutes dehumidification from <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Refrigerant/index.html">refrigerant</a> circuit) before each filling of the A/C system.<br>R 134a absorbs moisture very easily. Therefore seal off opened pipes, condenser, evaporator, compressor and drier bottle immediately with plugs.<br>With replacement parts, the plugs may only be removed immediately before the lines are connected.<br>In the event of warranty claims, the old parts must be provided with plugs to be able to determine the cause of the damage.<br>If an A/C system has been completely drained by leakage, accident or repair, the drier element must be replace as excessive moisture may have entered the system.<br>Store filled pressurized <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Refrigerant/index.html">refrigerant</a> bottles in such a way that they are not exposed to direct sunlight or other heat sources (max. 45 &deg;C). Also avoid exposing them to mechanical stress (e.g. by dropping).<br>In the event of fire, carbon dioxide (CO2), extinguishant powder and a sprayed water jet are deemed to be suitable extinguishants. Cool reservoirs at risk with a sprayed water jet (risk of bursting!).<br><br><b>Important!</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>After each refill of an A/C system, check that protective caps of filling valves are hand-tight. They serve as additional seals.<br></div>
