<h1>Maintenance - Condition Based Service (CBS) Overview</h1>SI B 00 07 02<br><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">Maintenance</a> and General Hints<br><br>February 2009<br>Technical Service<br><br>This Service Information bulletin supersedes SI B00 07 02 dated November 2007.<br><br>[NEW] designates changes to this revision<br><br>SUBJECT<br>Condition Based Service<br><br>MODEL<br>[NEW] All models with Condition Based Service<br><br>SITUATION<br>This information is intended to provide a general system overview of Condition Based Service (CBS), which is an advanced development of the previous Service Interval Indicator systems.<br><br>CBS measures, monitors and determines the required <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> of several service items independently of each other. This technology prompts the customer to bring the vehicle in for service whenever one of the CBS items requires maintenance or replacement. CBS strikes a compromise between too frequent maintenance intervals and too rigid service intervals that call for the replacement of service items that may still have substantial remaining useful life. CBS also details the recommended, due, and overdue required maintenance during and after the BMW Vehicle Maintenance Program Agreement.<br><br>[NEW] For details of CBS service items and <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> intervals, refer to the vehicle and model year specific Service Information bulletins entitled "New Vehicle Preparation and Maintenance Requirements" located in Group 00 or the relevant Owner's Manual.<br><br><b>SERVICE RECOGNITION</b><br><br>The vehicle recognizes when a service is required using the following three methods:<br><br>A. Adaptive, using sensor technology and algorithms to determine the required <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> of a service item depending upon the individual customer driving style. For example:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Oil change is determined from the engine oil condition sensor which monitors the oil condition, oil level, and oil temperature, and from additional algorithms using these parameters: engine load, fuel consumption, time and distance since the last oil change.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>[NEW] Microfilter replacement (dependent on vehicle model and CBS version).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Replacements of front and rear brake pads are determined from 2-stage brake lining wear sensors located on the left front and right rear brake pads, and from residual wear algorithms using these input parameters: travel distance, wheel speed, braking pressure, braking time, and braking frequency.<br><br>B. Fixed Time (months) to determine the required <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> of a service item. For example:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Brake%2520Fluid/index.html">Brake Fluid</a> and Engine Coolant changes.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>State Safety and Emissions Inspections.<br><br>C. Fixed Distance (miles) to determine the required <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> of a service item. For example:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle Check.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>[NEW] <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Tune-up%2520and%2520Engine%2520Performance%2520Checks/Spark%2520Plug/index.html">Spark plug</a> replacement (dependent on vehicle model and CBS version)<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>[NEW] State Safety and Emissions inspections<br><br>D.
