It lights at full brightness when the light switch is in the OFF position. It is dimmed to the same extent as the instrument and locator lights when they are switched on.<br><br><b>brake light switch</b><br>The brake light switch is permanently monitored by the LCM when terminal R is activated.<br><br>It is designed as a Hall sensor and features 3 lines (terminal R, terminal 31, signal line). The test switch is not necessary.<br><br><b>Hazard warning switch</b><br>The indicator lamp for the hazard warning function is located in the hazard warning switch. It also serves as a locator light.<br><br><b>Dimmer potentiometer</b><br>The dimmed instrument, locator and function lights (terminal 58g) is activated when the light switch is in the parking light or low beam light position.<br><br>The voltage generated at terminal 58g is dependent on the position of the dimmer potentiometer.<br><br><b>Activation of indicator lamps in the instrument cluster</b><br>The indicator lamps for left turn signal indicator, right turn signal indicator, rear fog light, fog light and high beam located in the instrument cluster are activated via the I-Bus/K-bus.<br><br><b>Lights</b><br>The lamps of the vehicle lighting system are monitored both when switched off and switched on (cold and warm monitoring).<br><br>The lamps are activated by means of transistors. Due to the fact that they are now short-circuit-protected, the standard lamp fuses are no longer necessary.<br><br>The lamps can also be activated via the diagnosis function.<br><br>The country-specific functions of the lamp circuits are coded.</div>
