If your vehicle has <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a> of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, then you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires. As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system, TPMS, that illuminates a low tire pressure warning lamp when one or more of your tires are significantly underinflated. When the low tire pressure warning lamp lights up, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly underinflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Underinflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability. Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a>, and it is the driver's responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if underinflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure warning lamp.<br><br>The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure warning lamp. When the system detects a malfunction, the warning lamp will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle startups as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a> or <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction warning lamp after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.</div>
