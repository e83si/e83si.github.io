The warning is illuminated when the tire pressure decreases by approximately 25 percent. Temperature fluctuations can cause changes in tire pressure. For every 10&deg; F change in ambient temperature, the tire pressure can change by 1 psi. Therefore, the tire warning indicator may be triggered due to a large change in temperature combined with a pre-existing low pressure condition.<br><br>When addressing customer concerns related to Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems, the following points should be noted:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems have been mandated by the Federal Government<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The thresholds necessary to illuminate the tire warning lamp are consistent with Federal Guidelines<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure <br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Under-inflation reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Customers should be advised to inspect their <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/index.html">tires</a> for physical damage and check the tire pressures when the tire warning is illuminated<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The use of Tire Pressure Monitor Systems does not eliminate the need for routine <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> by the vehicle operator.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>BMW recommends checking tire inflation pressures every two weeks and before long trips<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/12806369.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
