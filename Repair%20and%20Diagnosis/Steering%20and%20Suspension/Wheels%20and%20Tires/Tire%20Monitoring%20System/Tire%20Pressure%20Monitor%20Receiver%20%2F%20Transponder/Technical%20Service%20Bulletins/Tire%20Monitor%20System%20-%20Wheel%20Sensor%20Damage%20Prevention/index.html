Extra care must be taken when changing tires to avoid any damage to the wheel electronics. A damaged wheel electronic can cause the Tire Warning indicator to illuminate. The necessary precautions for mounting and dismounting tires are listed in Repair Instruction 36 12 005 "Replacing a runflat tyre or a UHP tyre". When diagnosing complaints related to the RDC system, the tires and wheels should be inspected for damage and/or prior replacement. The last four digits of the tire's DOT number indicate the calendar week, followed by the year in which the tire was produced. This information can be used to determine if one or more tires have been replaced.<br><br>WARRANTY INFORMATION<br>Wheel electronics which are damaged from improper mounting/dismounting of the tire and/or road hazards are not covered under warranty.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/IMP44Q313/euro130/12806369.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer</div>
