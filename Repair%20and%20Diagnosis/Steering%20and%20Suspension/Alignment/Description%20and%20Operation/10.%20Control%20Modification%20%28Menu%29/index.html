<h1>10. Control Modification (Menu)</h1><br><br><br><br><b>10. Control Modification (Menu)</b><br><br><b>10.1 Remote control with display</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The following steps show how the remote control with display is activated:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1. - Call up the "<b>Service</b>" menu in special functions ("<b>S</b>" key) <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2. - Call up the "<b>Remote control</b>" sub-menu in the "<b>Service</b>" menu.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3. - Select the "<b>Remote control with display</b>" item in the "<b>Remote control</b>" sub-menu - this configuration is retained.<br><br><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>In the case of equipment without remote control, this must be configured to "<b>No remote control</b>".<br><br><b>10.2 Brief operating instructions</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1. - Activate the remote control with the "<b>ON</b>" button (it may also be switched on during alignment). The title page will appear on the LCD.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2. - Select "<b>Straight ahead</b>" of the "<b>Initial measurement</b>", "<b>Adjustment work</b>" or "<b>Final measurement</b>" at the measuring equipment cabinet. The steering graphics for "<b>Straight ahead</b>" will appear on the LCD.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3. - Use the "<b>Forward arrow</b>" to change to the next measurement image. Display blocks will appear on the LCD with the designation of the measured value and tolerance bar with the measured value. If the measured value is within the tolerance range, it is shown in dark figures against a light background. If the measured value is outside the tolerance range, it will be shown in inverse video (light figures against a dark background).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4. - By pressing the "<b>F</b>" key shortly, you can move alternately between the designation of the measured value and the setpoint value with the tolerance inside the display blocks. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5. - You can scroll through the measured values using the "<b>Forward arrow</b>", "<b>Backward arrow</b>" and "<b>Cancel" (red dot)</b> keys. The function of these keys is identical to that of the keys on the graphics panel.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6. - Even with "<b>Free alignment</b>", it is possible to scroll through the measured values in the same way as with "<b>Program-guided alignment</b>".<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7. - During measurement, the report print-out can be initiated using the "<b>Printer</b>" key. The remote control keys are only active during measurement and adjustment (not during customer data input, vehicle selection etc.).<br><br><b>10.3 Display support</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Measured values with a setpoint/actual comparison and tolerance bar (setpoint figures can be displayed with the "<b>F</b>" key)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Steering graphics for steering routines <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Overview of measured values with current setpoint/actual comparison <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- Rim run-out compensation <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>- With all other functions (e.g. customer input), the title illustration appears on the LCD display<br><br><b>Note:</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the data transmission from the remote control to the computer is interrupted, the remote control icon in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen changes colour from green to red and the illustration on the LCD display is shown inversely - black turns to white, white to black. This change does not take place in the title illustration. Once the line-of-sight connection has been re-established, the remote control continues to operate from the point of interruption in the program. A continuous visual connection during alignment is therefore not necessary.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The "<b>Hour glass</b>" icon in the LCD display means: "<b>Please wait</b>". <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The "<b>Battery</b>" icon in the top right-hand corner of the LCD display means that the battery reserve has been reached. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>To switch off the remote control: press the "<b>F</b>" key for 5 seconds, then return it to its charging unit or connect it to a charge cable. The title illustration will again appear as a charging check. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If, during the measurement, the remote control has been placed back in the charging unit, it must be switched on again using the "<b>ON</b>" button.</div>
