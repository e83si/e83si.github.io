Information on replacing <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Steering%2520Gear/index.html">steering gear</a> after accident damage</b><br><br><b>Situation:</b><br>In the event of accidents or driving conditions similar to accidents, shocklike loads can cause different types of damage to <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Steering%2520Gear/index.html">steering gears</a>. When a steering gear is externally undamaged, it is sometimes only possible to identify damage with great difficulty and with great effort. However, damage of this nature poses an unacceptable risk to the vehicle because it can result in failure of the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/">steering</a> system.<br><br>Because of the disproportionate amount of effort involved, it is generally not sensible to check thoroughly all the individual components of the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Steering%2520Gear/index.html">steering gear</a> and as an alternative it is necessary to take into account other components which can be checked more easily.<br><br><b>Procedure:</b><br><br>The <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Steering%2520Gear/index.html">steering gear</a> must be replaced if one or more of the following points apply:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Visible or noticeable damage to the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Steering%2520Gear/index.html">steering gear</a><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Version with electric steering gear (EPS): Examine in particular the control unit with all plug connections for damage and hairline cracks.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>B.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Unacceptable torque increase and jamming when the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Steering%2520Gear/index.html">steering gear</a> is turned from lock to lock (without hydraulic/electrical assistance)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>C.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Permissible tolerances exceeded during axle/wheel alignment (include alignment record with invoice/report if necessary)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>D.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fire damage<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>E.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Damage, permanent deformation or fractures to:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Wheel rims in the event of a negative result from the wheel/axle alignment check<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Spring struts, <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/">steering</a> knuckles, wheel carriers<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/Control%20Arm/">Control arms</a><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>struts or diagonal members or stabilisers with this function<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Body-side screwing/bolting points for wheel guide/control components<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Front axle support<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Pitman arms<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Tie%2520Rod/index.html">Tie rods</a><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Steering%2520Gear/index.html">Steering gear</a> fixtures<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/Steering%20Column/">Steering Column</a><br><br>This guideline is binding for all accident repairs to BMW and MINI vehicles.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  If the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Steering%2520Gear/index.html">steering gear</a> replacement work which is required for safety reasons is refused by the customer or an insurance company for cost reasons, a memorandum to that effect must be drawn up and countersigned by the party bearing the costs of the accident repair.<br><br>For corresponding specimen of memorandum, refer to SI 320188(828) Appendix 1.<br><br><b>IMPORTANT:  The vehicle's type approval will be invalidated whenever the function of any of its safety components is compromised.</b></div>
