      <b>Navigating the site.</b> Navigating our manuals can be unintuitive. Keep in mind that
      multiple pages, with different URLs, may point to pages with the exact same content. This is
      normal. Also, the blue boxes occasionally overlaid on images are links you can click.

      <b>Archive Initiative.</b> We release the database and computer code that powers Operation
      CHARM publicly. This makes sure we do not monetize CHARM, and that someone else can set up a
      new equivalent site if CHARM goes down. The download is over 700GB and may be difficult to use
      if you are not a programmer. <a href="operation-charm.torrent">Download our data!</a> (using a
      P2P protocol to save bandwidth. Add charm.li:17471 as a peer if you have trouble).
