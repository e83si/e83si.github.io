Instructions for using car manuals downloaded from Operation Charm:

1. Extract the entire .zip file. Usually "extract all" button will do this.
   You cannot open individual files, the images will not work. Must extract the whole zip first.
2. Open the folder you extracted to.
3. Double-click "index.html" in the folder! If this does not work, open your browser,
   then press Ctrl+O, then find index.html in the file manager.

Known BUG: Sometimes the links will not work on Windows. In this case, use the file manager to find the page you want.
